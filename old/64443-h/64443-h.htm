<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>In the <i>Art of Interesting</i> (Kenedy, 1920) the
writer began a discussion of the principles of art
and of their application to writing and speaking. In
this work the discussion is carried further and is not
restricted to the one feature of arousing and fixing
attention, especially in oratory, which was the chief
topic of the <i>Art of Interesting</i>. The following chapters
represent the reactions of the writer to literature
both as composed today and as taught in our
schools. Any active mind, bewildered by the ceaseless
experimenting in literature and education, and
not satisfied with a passive acceptance of even excellent
critics, is necessarily forced back upon first
principles. Such a mind will not yield to the despair
of skepticism, that there are no first principles, nor to
the despair of agnosticism, that there may be such
principles but we cannot know them, nor yet to the
despair of pragmatism, that we must wait and see
whether the human race ages from now will give us
assurance that there really are principles of art
because the last man has seen that these principles
have been found to work up to the moment prior to
which he joined Tutankhamen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<p>Art, just as morals and pure science, differs entirely
from the natural sciences, which are generalizations
based upon acquired information and must
change as long as the information upon which they
are based can be modified and enlarged. But where,
as in art or pure science, principles are based on final
truths, the principles have also a finality and can
only be rejected if their basis can be changed or
modified. Aristotle’s principles have something of
that finality. Aristotle had for his study a body of
literature that has for centuries met with the approval
of the best taste in every age and of every
critic. Aristotle’s biology or physics are not final,
but his ethics, his logic, his esthetics are in measurable
distance of finality except where some additions
have been made to the materials upon which he
based his analysis. In religion, because of revelation,
in music because of discoveries in instrumentation,
and perhaps in other arts, time has added to
the original store, but in literature there are few
additions to the fields which lay before Aristotle,
and subsequent ages have not developed any keener
analytical powers than those of Aristotle.</p>

<p>It is Aristotle’s principles that in the main have
dominated the writer’s reactions to modern art and
literature. When Greek literature held an honored
place in our schools, there was less need of insisting
on obvious truths of art. The intense modernism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
now predominating everywhere has driven classical
literature and classical methods from school and
life. History is modernized too or fails to supply
the vital contact with the ever-living past which
earlier schools experienced in the poets, historians,
orators and philosophers of Greece and Rome. So-called
cultural subjects in modern education are
chiefly informational. Culture is a word which
calls for definition, but on its intellectual side at
least, culture for the largest number of persons in
the world can be gauged most satisfactorily by their
appreciation of literature and by their capacity to
produce literature. The study of literature as an
art is the chief topic of this book, and Aristotle’s
great principles need all the more stressing now that
his philosophy of art and the supreme literature on
which he based his conclusions are passing away
from present-day consciousness.</p>

<p>The chapters that follow are popular rather than
scientific in presentation. Readers who seek a fuller
and wider view may be interested in such a work as
Benedetto Croce’s <i>Æsthetic</i>, from the Italian by
Douglas Ainslie. Its historical summary, especially
for modern times, is valuable and good. For the
Greeks and earlier periods, Butcher’s <i>Aristotle’s
Theory of Poetry and Fine Arts</i> is easily best.
Professor Rhys Roberts’ editions of the works of
Dionysius, Longinus and Demetrius are excellent for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
the traditions of classical rhetoric, a tradition weak
in America.</p>

<p>In theory Croce is an extreme intellectualist in
the principles of art. He locates all of esthetics in
pure intuition, which is “lyrical,” that is, emotional,
because it represents “the states of the soul,” “passionality,
feeling, personality.” For Croce “natural
beauty is simply a stimulus to esthetic reproduction,
which presupposes previous production.” He is
therefore an idealist in his conception of beauty.
Even monuments of art seem to be only “stimulants
to esthetic reproduction” and are not beautiful in
themselves. In another place, however, Croce
seems to be a realist. “Art is governed entirely by
imagination; its only riches are images. Art does
not classify objects nor pronounce them real or
imaginary nor qualify them nor define them. Art
feels and represents them. In as far as it apprehends
‘the real’ immediately before it is modified and
made clear by the concept, it must be called pure
intuition.”</p>

<p>Quite to the other extreme in theory goes <i>The
Psychology of Beauty</i> by Ethel D. Puffer. This author
has much about sensations and their physiology
and but little about ideas. For Croce the last stage
is in the idea; for Puffer it would seem to be in the
work of art. “The low-lying wide expanse of some
of the old Dutch landscapists give us repose, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
because they remind us of the peaceful happiness of
the land but because we cannot melt ourselves into
all those horizontal lines without the restful feeling
which accompanies such relaxation.” This passage
might almost class the writer with the <i>Einfühlung</i>
school,—the school which gives Ruskin’s “pathetic
fallacy” a number of advocates. Pathetic fallacy
was a complete misnomer when applied by Ruskin
to the well-known tropes of metaphor and personification.
Kingsley was not insane enough to imagine
that a wave was actually cruel and actually crawled.
He likened the wave that drowned to a wild animal.
But the school of Lipps in Germany desires you to
moan with the wind and smile with the rose and
lie flat with painted horizontal lines.</p>

<p>Perhaps Puffer’s formula of stimulation with repose
and Croce’s formula of intuition with lyricism
can be reconciled with Aquinas’ definition of the
beautiful, <i>quæ visa placent</i>. A study of Maurice
De Wulf’s excellent little volume <i>L’Œuvre d’Art et
la Beauté</i> gives us briefly and clearly the neo-scholastic
solution of the esthetic problem. The book is
a good example of the reasonable discussion which
has won for scholastic philosophy the universal
designation as the philosophy of common sense.
Longhaye’s <i>Théorie des Belles Lettres</i>, which is
scholastic philosophy applied to literature, is another
clear and sane presentation of the principles
of the art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span></p>

<p>The reader who desires to supplement the popular
exposition of this book with a systematic treatise on
the esthetic and its application to literature is recommended
to De Wulf and to Longhaye. English
is rich in criticism but is deficient in works treating
of the philosophy of beauty in literature.</p>

<span class="smaller">ART AND THE INDIVIDUAL</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>1. INDIVIDUALISM AND RESPONSIBILITY</h4>

<p>A group was standing before a futurist or
cubist picture. The group did not know what
the picture was all about, but one spoke up in defense
of the bewildering work: “Well, after all,
art is a language, and why shouldn’t a man be permitted
to speak his own language?” A bystander,
not daring to address strangers, made answer under
his breath: “If art is a language, this artist is talking
to himself.” Maudlin, incoherent remarks,
disjointed utterances, and in general talking to one’s
self, all that, does not pass for high art among men,
but for something quite different. To talk to one’s
self is the extreme of individualism in conversation;
to ignore the world addressed through artistic composition
is the triumph of individualism in art.</p>

<p>The abrupt break with all tradition in every art,
and the untrammeled expression of the individual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
have worked out to the inevitable and bizarre conclusions
which a like rebellion has brought about in
religion and morals. Every man his own dogmatist;
every man his own moralist; that is the
individualism which has divided mankind into multitudinous
sects and has made millions of moral,
unmoral and immoral moralists eager for legislation
of infinite variety without any fixed principles
to enforce the observance of even one law. Conscience,
the executive impulse of all legislation, used
to be the voice of God, but individualism has made
it anything from a survival of the fittest or an
economic standard, through countless varieties all
the way to a Freudian complex.</p>

<p>Individualism has run amuck in art from classicism
to cubism. It is a barren day which does not
produce a new system of religion or morals, and
only the occurrence of earthquake, war, fire or some
other tremendous upheaval keeps our journals from
recording some new theory of art, some Tomism,
Dickism or Harryism. Art for art’s sake has been
given an individualistic interpretation and has produced
the same rich crop, as the individualistic cry,
every man his own dogmatist and moralist, has produced—a
rich crop of weeds.</p>

<p>If ever an individual could pursue his blissful way
oblivious of the existence of a surrounding universe,
surely he may not do so now when the universe
impinges upon him every moment through ticker,
telephone, wireless and unlimited “extras.” There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
is, however, no such thing as unrestricted individualism.
Of God alone can be predicated existence for
its own sake. Everybody his own dogmatist means
ultimately everybody his own god. Art for art’s
sake, interpreted in an individualistic sense, would
not only destroy art but would destroy the world.
Art for art’s sake should read art for everybody’s
sake and for the sake of God, and such a reading
will be infinitely better for art’s sake.</p>

<p>It was an Irish colleen, accepting matrimony as a
complete submergence of individuality, who replied
to a friend dwelling on the dangers of a long ocean
trip to be taken by the new bride and groom: “And
why should I be afraid, sure ’tis his loss if anything
happen to me now!” She was the counterpart of
the Irish lad who sang under similar circumstances,
“I’m not myself at all.” There you have the complete
altruism resulting from the perfect union of
matrimony. There is the antithesis of individualism,
and such matrimonial communism is far better
for every one than any cry of “wife for wife’s sake”
or “husband for husband’s sake.”</p>

<p>It is quite evident that no artist can exempt himself
from responsibility as though his art were a
deity. If a picture or statue or poem would be an
incentive to murder or suicide, the artist must stay
his hand. He may not manufacture bombs for soul
destruction, no matter how artistic the container,
even if someone else is to supply the detonator. A
lie in beautiful language is a more ugly lie. Recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
pretended upholders of the Volstead law have
printed an emphatic warning on compounds of
their manufacture: “Do not add such an ingredient
or this compound will violate the law.” May an
artist naïvely dissociate himself from responsibility
by stating: “Do not add human nature to my art-product
or you will violate the law”? Were the
artist a real creator, he would have to forecast results
and be dominated by a purpose. Nor may the
artist, like God, permit evil, because no artist has
omnipotence and infinite wisdom and justice and
mercy, governing the permission of evil and guaranteeing
good as the final result. May a man who
owns a wild tiger of surpassing beauty, trusting in
the right of property, parade down a crowded thoroughfare
with his jungle pet tethered to a thread?</p>

<p>But why all these truisms? Because individualism
in art aims in principle and production not only
to free art from restrictions but even to exempt the
artist from responsibility. The artist may not talk
to himself unless he can find a South Sea island
where there is neither man nor God. Nor is it a
deadening of his artistic impulse for the artist to be
ruled by high purposes, but rather it is a stimulus and
an inspiration. Eschylus and Sophocles have a
sublimer beauty than Euripides because the earlier
dramatists recognized more fully and kept better in
view the religious purposes of Athenian drama.
Euripides, wishing to cater more to theatric effects,
succeeded in being more emotional and in achieving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
a realistic but transient interest, the hectic flush that
marks decay and death in twilight and autumn and
sinister disease. Is the marked revival of Euripides
within recent years a sign of decadence?</p>

<p>The Madonnas of Italian art received from the
painter a solemn beauty not only because they depict
Divine maternity, but even too because they
were to grace a religious shrine and to constitute
part of a religious service. That may be one reason
why the Madonnas of Italy are far superior
to the prettiness and sentimentality of more recent
Madonnas which are painted for private homes and
for ephemeral interest.</p>

<p>The purpose of the artist is one thing and the
purpose of art is another thing. The purpose of a
watch is to keep time whatever purpose the watch-maker
may have. It is likely, however, that if he
makes the watch for his mother, he will produce
better results than if he worked for his usual wage
or than if he functioned as part of a machine, having
no clearly defined ulterior purpose. So an artist
will be inspired in painting, in sculpture, in music,
in all arts, to elicit better his full powers and to
achieve finer results when he toils for a cathedral
than when he works for a cabaret. Noble responsibility
conscientiously recognized and fulfilled is no
check, but rather a spur to the artist.</p>

<p>“Art for art’s sake” may, however, be taken to
mean, “Embody beauty wherever found, or realize
to the full your ideal,” and such a meaning is excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and fruitful unless excessive individualism
insists upon expressing its own perverted ideas of
beauty and its own eccentric ideals. When Horace
said, “Let justice be done though the heavens come
crashing down,” a line that might be rendered, “Justice
for justice’s sake,” he was far from advocating
the explosion of a bomb by some Roman anarchist
whose idea of justice was to bring all to a dead
level of ruin. The progressive improvement in the
realization of art-ideals may be very well illustrated
from the career of Horace. Horace gradually
worked himself free from the conventionality and
baseness of his epodes and earlier satires, experienced
the cleansing process of true humor in later
satires, took fire at the moral degeneracy of Rome
in the initial odes of the third and last book of his
first edited lyrics. There the <i>sæva indignatio</i> of
Horace brought him within distant sight of sublimity.
His progress in philosophy weighted the
wings of his song but dowered him with the crystal
and clean wisdom of his epistles, of which it has
been said one need not blot out a single line. Had
Horace retained the youthful vehemence of the republican
amid the enervating peace of the new empire,
he might have followed Dante and Milton
from lyric beauty to epic sublimity, or might have
risen with Shakespeare and Molière from song to
comedy or even to tragedy, but his hedonistic sleekness
and his excessive self-consciousness kept his
ripened philosophy in brief letters, when a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
vigorous mentality with the help of philosophy
might have converted his ennobled power of satire
into comedy or transformed the lyric portraits of
his early days into tragedy or epic story.</p>

</div>

<h4>2. VAGARIES OF INDIVIDUALISM</h4>

<p>Modern art has not followed Horace very
far. It has broken with conventionality as
Horace did with the <i>clichés</i> of Alexandria, but it
has not yet entered upon the path of right philosophy.
The <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>, a typical
specimen from the individualistic school of what
might be called localists or village gossips, is in
the epode-stage of Horace, the stage of personalities,
lubricity and garlic gruesomeness. Hopes
might be entertained that <i>Spoon River</i> and <i>Main
Street</i> and other individualistic photographs would
progressively improve with Horace except for one
sad deficiency: Horace had humor and laughed at
others, and even at himself; modern individualists
are so heavily armored with the seriousness of their
own views, that they don’t even smile. To imagine
the New Art laughing is impossible; if the New Art
had humor and laughed, it would cease to be New
Art and would join the larger brotherhood of art
uncapitalized. Had the new artists a sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
humor, it would probably be their death sentence.
In the course of time they might catch sight of their
own art products, whether of painting or of poetry.</p>

<p>Is it not an indication of individualism that so
many recent novels are biographies, that the stage
is not holding up the mirror to life but applying the
scalpel to an ulcer? The biography or personal
views of Scott and Shakespeare cannot be discovered
in their works. The modern pamphleteer distributes
his paradoxes among various mouthpieces
whose only difference is in name, and this is called
a play, when it is in reality propaganda. There are
probably now no less than 100,000 college graduates
turning college escapades and flirtations into chapters,
which their authors consider typical of life because
the incidents were individually experienced.
And, as the long stories of the day are biographies
or problems and as the drama is a diagnosis of
diseases, in the same way many of the short stories
are pathological, but all are tending to be individualistic.
The artist makes his own subjective experience
the full measure of his artistic expression
and seems to imagine that his own peculiarities are
good art because he sincerely expresses what he
feels. Individual nature is not human nature.</p>

<p>Aristotle has described poetry as the universal
in the concrete. The “new poets” give the individual
in the concrete. Homer, Shakespeare, the
true poets, plumb to the depths of the human heart;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
they voice ripened experience and enshrine mellow
wisdom, and so appeal to all men of all times.
Much of the new poetry ostentatiously disdains tradition
and rejects the wisdom of the ages in discarding
its dress. You may see the rouge on the
cheek and the freckle on the nose, but as far as life
and experience and heart are concerned, most of
the new poetry is pitiably young and callous. Meticulous
recording of disconnected and unrelated novelties
is no adequate substitute for the warmth and
depth of life crystallized by the ardent gaze of the
true poet out of his experience. New poetry is contemporaneous
with the invention and use of the
Kodak and has all the responsibility and profundity
of that instrument.</p>

<p>Individualism has come to such a pass in modern
art that everything in it is resolving itself into pure
emotionalism, and that an emotionalism which does
not belong to art at all. Degenerates are the products
of civilization; they are decayed exotics. “The
higher the organism, the more noisome the decay,”
a science professor used to say when paying his respects
to diseased metaphysics. As only a believer
can blaspheme luridly, so when an artist goes wrong,
he goes wrong hideously. A pistol in the hands
of a marksman gone mad is more destructive than
in the hands of a savage. Colors, sounds, shapes,
fair words and gorgeous imaginings are instruments
of degradation and death if they are a finer veneer
over what is false. Individual vagaries and whims,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
no matter how unusual, will not have the permanence
of art because they are based on no principles,
but devised simply to startle. Degrade the appeal
of beauty to a spinal thrill and your artist will pander
to concupiscence.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Homer’s worst lapse in story-telling
takes place among the luxurious Phæacians,
ancient prototypes of degeneracy. Homer may
have felt justified artistically because he was depicting
the non-Grecian world through whose monsters
and marvels Odysseus was passing and making
the first collection of sailors’ yarns. But Homer
shocked even the pagan world and set an unhappy
precedent. Lucian and Ovid, Petronius and
Apuleius and the Byzantine eroticists made what
was incidental in Homer their chief concern and
practice. They perverted fiction into calculated
suggestiveness.</p>

<p>That depraved and sensual theory of story-telling
was, however, more Aristophanic than Homeric,
despite the single unfortunate precedent in the
<i>Odyssey</i>. The tradition of Greek and Latin
comedy was carried on by the medieval troubadours
and by the story-tellers who catered to the decadent
nobility of Italy and France. They retorted on
their clerical censors and stimulated jaded appetites,
substituting in shameless intrigues priests and nuns
for the pagan gods. It was and is the glory of
Scott that he broke away from these evil traditions
which made the novel a hateful thing to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
forefathers. Scott deserted the continental school
of novelists and their English imitators, Fielding,
Sterne, Smollett, the last of all Byron. Scott gave
up the satirical purposes which handed on in fiction
the vulgar devices of low comedy. He went to history,
to chivalry, to healthy men and women and
created romances, not pathological studies. English,
Irish and American fiction for a whole century
yielded to the healthy and bracing impulse of Scott,
but the younger novelists in vogue today in England,
Ireland and America have gone back to the
continental type, individual, pathological biographical
problems, forsaking Scott’s revival through balladry
of the best Homeric manner, where men
“drank delight of battle with their peers far on the
ringing plains of Troy.”</p>

<p>The individualist must emancipate himself by
the contemplation of nature. Pathological specimens,
freakish oddities, all the surface impressions
of the local colorists are not nature any more than
a face contorted with a toothache is a man’s likeness.
Such exceptional exhibitions cannot form the
enduring basis of art. Personal experience must
be widened by length of time, by merging into the
stream of wisdom, flowing freighted from the past,
or must, in exceptional cases, be won quickly by that
intense and probing comprehension of genius, which
seems almost Divine intuition. Excessive individualism,
like the latest fashion, will be quaint and incongruous
on the morrow. Homer lives eternal because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
through strange names and strange language
and strange costumes we see our own sun and fields
and ocean and sky and put our fingers on a pulse
which registers the beat of a heart throbbing as ours.</p>

<span class="smaller">ART AND HUMAN NATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>1. THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT</h4>

<p>A serious defect in most modern art movements
is that they start from art; they are
modifications of previous art movements. True art
movements start from human nature. When perfection
in any art is standardized, when tradition
and conventionality prevail, and the artist has originality
enough to chafe at the restraints of classicism
but not originality enough to reveal finer ideals
through classic expression, his temptation is to rebel
at conventionalities and to deem himself original
because he is unconventional. He wishes to be different
from other artists and seeks for the difference
by discarding the traditional medium rather than
by improving his own personal message. He prefers
to be different and even original by cutting his ginger-bread
into the shape of automobiles and air-planes
instead of going back to mother’s classic make
and blending his ingredients into a new creation,
a creation which will make fresh appeal even in
former animal shapes or in the traditional ginger-bread
cart-wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>Art is a social institution. If not by the people,
art is of the people, and certainly for the people.
When Greek literary art grew conventional in its
different forms, the artists went back to the people
for another medium to be transfigured by art. Ruskin
has called architecture a “glorified roof.” The
sonata is a glorified folk melody; epic is glorified
folk lore; and Greek drama is a glorified folk song,
as Elizabethan drama is a glorified folk chronicle.
Both dramas have their roots in the religious services
of the people. Homer told us about the public
he had, but the nineteenth century would not trust
his word until Schliemann dug up the great halls
where Demodokos and his fellows told the people
their own folk stories in a glorified, artistic form.
Greek lyric and Greek pastoral were as public as
Greek oratory, Greek choruses, temples and statuary.
It was left for Roman conquerors to begin the
segregation of art into the cold storage of the
modern millionaire and of the modern museum.</p>

<p>The permanence of Greek art is based upon that
public appeal. Art is long because it embodies
nature, and most of all human nature. Homer
has appealed to man, woman and child for thousands
of years. His human nature is our human
nature despite external differences of every
kind. Homer himself was aware of the appeal
of nature in art. On the shield of Achilles, he
marveled at the field which grew black behind the
plowing, a marvel of Homer’s close study of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
as well as an expression of his ideal for art. Nature
is a language all can understand and human nature
is a language all must and do understand. When
lament was made over the body of Patroklos, the
elegy of Briseis stirred all, “and thereon the women
wailed, in semblance for Patroklos, but each for her
own woe.” Similar is the appeal of art where in
semblance of something else, each sees what belongs
to self. Aristotle in seeking to explain the
characteristic pleasure of art ascribes it to <i>mimesis</i>
or re-presentation in another medium. Such staging,
he says, not only robs the terrifying of its terrors
but enables all to understand and reason to
the nature of each art product. Such understanding
and reasoning mean surely something more than the
mere recognition of photographic accuracy and likeness.
If we may press the meaning of the Greek
word used for reason, the process of art enjoyment
is similar to the syllogistic process which involves
an appeal to a general statement. The process is
one which recognizes the general in a particular
case, as the grief of Briseis found an echoing grief
in every heart.</p>

<p>Whether Aristotle and this interpretation of
him is correct or not, it is evident that art must
generalize. Art must select, both by choice of the
artist and by the limitations of his medium. Art
does not photograph, because it has no sensitive
plate for its medium. The photographer’s art
largely precedes the camera and consists in selecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
that pose and that expression, out of many, which
is yours. The camera is nature, controlled by
mechanism, and is not art. If the photographer or
painter or sculptor photographed you in some passing
spasm, we should not learn and reason that it
was you. The spasm was realism and fact, but
it was peculiar and individual; it was not you whom
we have known and generalized from experience.
In such a case, Aristotle says shrewdly, we might
get artistic pleasure from the workmanship or
colors, that is, from the medium and the mechanics
of art, but we should have no artistic pleasure from
the soul and substance of the art product because
the product found no prototype in our experience,
because we could not define it or generalize it. Art
selects. It cannot give everything, and if it would
be true, it must give what all may understand; it
must give what is generally true, and what is generally
true of all men is human nature.</p>

<p>Selective idealism has usually the advantage of
being intelligible, but it labors under the disadvantage
of becoming merely intelligible. It gives the
truth, but through familiarity the beauty or artistic
appeal of the truth has been dulled and tarnished,
or, like the dandelion, until a Lowell gives it a
new luster, its very commonness leaves us unmoved.
We enjoy human nature in Homer because
he was the creator of sleeping winds and of
rosy-fingered dawns and of the mother’s smile alight
through tears. A modern who would transfer these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
same touches to his own composition would leave
us cold. He too must create; he must be personal,
but he must not be individual. Personality is the
knowing and loving principle, and looks to the many
with its thoughts and wishes. Individuality is the
principle of separation and isolation and is looking
inward, not outward. When the artist, therefore,
creates and gives his own winds or dawn or
mother love, he should speak to us in his own concrete
embodiments of nature, and of human nature,
using a language man understands. If selective
idealism tends to become merely intelligible and
unappealing, individualism tends to become unintelligible
and to mystify.</p>

<p>The poet, the novelist, the painter have more
depth than silver nitrate on a photographic plate.
Artists do not simply mirror nature; they do not
catch at the odd or freakish. That is photography,
not creation. Horace did not give us a moving picture
of a falling tree, but he saw the humor and
human interest of that “sorry log.” Burns did not
give us an anatomical study of the typhus-carrier on
a lady’s bonnet in a kirk, making it crawl upon ourselves
and sending us after the kerosene can and
bath tub, but Burns soared away, from that sight
with Horatian humor and Horatian human nature,
into the immortal lines, “O wad some power the
giftie gie us.” The artist who confounds the generalized
mental attractiveness found in true art with
the shock of nerves or the tickling of concupiscence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
or with misguided realism, will not produce things
of beauty. He gets a thrill, but it is not the permanent,
undying thrill of art, not the thing of
beauty, which is a joy forever.</p>

</div>

<h4>2. REALISM AND REALITY</h4>

<p>At an exhibition in New York City there was
displayed a picture of an ocean wave upon the
crest of which the artist had nailed a real bar of
soap. The first idea of the spectator was to consider
this peculiar product an advertisement, but
it seems to have been intended as a serious, if perverted,
attempt at art. If the artist was not slyly
proposing the caricature of excessive realism, the
cake of soap will serve well as a parable for those
artists who do not distinguish between realism and
reality.</p>

<p>The ultra-realist forgets that art is a creation,
the making of another world. The artist cannot
really create what he puts into his new world of
sight or hearing or imagination, of color, of sound,
of words. If he could actually make something new,
not based on nature or on human nature, he would
do so on the penalty of being unintelligible. Neither
should he go to the other extreme and not leave the
world of reality at all. He may not eat his cake
and have it. If what he takes from actuality is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
merged fully into his art form, he tries to give us
fact and fiction, history and art, in the same product,
and he nails a piece of soap on a painted wave.</p>

<p>Aristotle insists above all on probability in art,
or motivation, as it is now commonly called. A
probable or well-motived impossibility, he says, is
more artistic and pleasing than an improbable, that
is, an unmotived fact. For a like reason he demands
that fiction be more philosophical than history.
We accept a chronicle of facts without necessarily
being aware of their causal connections. In
the realms of art the connection must be established.
This principle, so fruitful for art, is not to be understood
as justifying or approving that school of
subjective novelists which is parsimonious in happenings
but diffuse in reasoning and gives us a maximum
of discussion with a minimum of incident.
Aristotle is thinking more of the people who witness
the drama. The spectators want the motivation
and plausibility of action rather than that of
logic. The soliloquy has gone from the stage; the
printed soliloquy should be curtailed in the novel.
A true understanding of motivation will send all
artists back to nature and to human nature for
those incidents which are the springs of action
and do not require lengthy logic to labor at their
explanation. Homer is completely lacking in logical
refining. Incident leads to feeling and talk, which
gives rise to further incident. Action, feeling and
character, Aristotle’s trinity of art subjects, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
mingled and detailed, and the story moves on in a
way plausible and pleasing to Homeric audiences.
When Homer runs short of motivation, he does not
resort to logic; he refers the causality to the gods,
as modern writers refer all insoluble problems to
evolution, which puts hardly more restrictions upon
imagination than Homeric mythology.</p>

<p>The artist must transfer his product wholly to
the world of art. Sculptured horses must not neigh,
nor painted flowers give perfume, but neighing and
scents may be suggested even in stone, and in lines
by art happenings, which all may read running if the
artist will use the language of human nature. He
should paint his cake of soap in, not nail it on. If
the exigencies of the story demand it, costumes of the
night or costumes of bathing may be in place, but
it is nailing on a cake of soap, it is outraging probabilities,
to force a story into a setting or to adopt a
style of dress or of undress simply for the sake of
producing a shock. That is the shock of reality,
not of art and beauty. Should the dramatist have
an excellent quartet and stop the play in order to
give a song, he is nailing on a piece of soap, which
may be magnificent soap, but it is not art.</p>

<p>Why is the so-called realism depressing? Why is
the Russian novelist left for the connoisseur but is
caviar to the general? Is it the presence or absence
of evil? Hardly that. Homer’s stories are full of
evil and of death; Sophocles’ <i>King Œdipus</i> and the
<i>Prometheus</i> of Eschylus are surcharged with evil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
but they do not depress. Euripides, on the other
hand, and Lucian have more alleged realism and are
depressing, even when they cause a smile. The realist
is cynical, and cynics do not soar off into the world
of art, but keep tethering themselves to the real
world. They do not lose themselves in their story
because they are always thinking of keeping some
one’s nose against their grindstone. Why should the
optimistic moralizing of Polyanna be resented by
critics any more than the cynic moralizing of Shaw
or of <i>Main Street</i>? The cheerful idiot and the purblind
dyspeptic are depressing in real life, especially
when they are moralizing, but in and out of art we
can laugh at the idiot, while we squirm at the assumed
superiority of the cynic. The moralizing is
a cake of soap.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is not depressing and Homer is not
depressing. They do not blink the facts of life, and
beyond the humor and humanity which saves them
and their audience, they lose themselves in their
story. The evil they depict is true evil, so recognized,
in their art-world. It is, besides, evil called
for by their story, not lugged in for a moral or to
exemplify a theory of art. They know that drab
is not the only color in life. They know that bright
things are as real as black things, but they are not
illustrating a theory but giving us a story. We pass
with them into a fictitious world, and the things
which depress the denizens of that world do not
depress us if we are not brought back to reality by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
stumbling on a cake of real soap, not integrated
with the story.</p>

<p>The sight of his dog Argos made the heart of
Odysseus sink. Even for those who think ugliness
the only reality, Argos was covered with realities
and squatted on reality. He depressed his master
but he does not depress us. He lies upon Main
Street and has a Polyanna wag to his tail. His optimism
and his pessimism are, however, not tacked
on. “And lo, a hound raised up his head and
pricked his ears, Argos, the hound of Odysseus....
Despised he lay (his master being afar) in the
deep dung of mules and swine.... There lay the
dog Argos, full of vermin. Yet even now when he
was aware of Odysseus standing by, he wagged his
tail and dropped both his ears, but nearer to his
master he had not the strength to draw. But Odysseus
looked aside and wiped a tear.” Argos is the
ideal dog of a far away master; “who has lost his
dominion,” as Eumæus, the shepherd of Odysseus,
says. Argos registers the fate of his master. We
feel, but we do not feel depressed. It is human;
it is all inevitable; it is real as life but perfectly
idealized by perfect transfer to the realm of art.
Eumæus gives us the morality of it, the truth of it,
but he is far from moralizing, either pessimistically
or optimistically. Argos is the dog Schneider that
Jefferson’s Rip Van Winkle could not find to recognize
him; he is the picture in brief of his master’s
fate. Eumæus is as free from all obtrusive soap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
as Argos himself. The dog’s fate is ascribed to the
careless women who “are no more inclined to honest
service when their masters have lost dominion, for
Zeus takes away the half of a man’s virtue when the
day of slavery comes upon him.”</p>

<span class="smaller">ART AND THE DIVINE</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>1. RELIGIOUS ORIGIN OF ART</h4>

<p>The recent discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamen
has aroused the interest of the
world. The perseverance of the explorer, the variety,
artistic excellence and intrinsic value of the discovery
gave the news a place in the press and
signalized the latest triumph of the spade, which
Schliemann converted into the best of historians.
Dig in your back-yard, and you can read its past
in the layers before your eyes. Make a cross-section
of the country, and successive deposits will tell you
its story. Lay bare the strata of the earth, and the
buried fossils, the minerals, the gas, the oil, reveal
the history of the world. Grave-digging is the most
productive occupation to which science, art and even
commerce can now be vocationally guided.</p>

<p>What was it that enriched the Egyptian tomb and
other tombs of the past in which man was buried?
It was religion, and specifically it was belief in the
immortality of the soul. The latest opened tomb
repeats the truth that was manifest in the pyramids
of Egypt, which were temples as well as tombs. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
beehive tombs of Mycenæ from which Schliemann
actually shoveled gold ornaments of various kinds
were also temples as well as tombs. The altar-stones
in Catholic churches with their tiny <i>loculi</i> for
the relic of a saint keep still the memory of the
days when persecuted Christians found the Catacombs
of the dead places of worship as well as of
escape from the persecutor.</p>

<p>The caves of Cro-Magnon and Aurignac and
other ancient deposits in France and Spain have
disclosed the earliest evidence of man’s art. The
man was no mean artist, and the coloring and skillful
drawing have astonished every one. Why dark
caverns, inaccessible to light, should have been so
decorated has puzzled observers. Reinach calls
the pictures early “magic,” painting of animals to
capture them. But there are paintings of men as
well as of bisons and reindeer. Professor Osborne
is quoted as saying that it seems to be art for art’s
sake, namely, that the sheer pleasure of the drawing
is its reason. An admission, it would seem,
that the professor has no real explanation to offer.
Sir Bertram Windle has recently asserted the religious
origin of these pictures. They would seem to
be the earliest appearance of stained-glass windows.
The caves were temples, and the explanation is
confirmed by a comparison with the beehive tombs
of Mycenæ and with the Egyptian tombs. The
altar, the sacrifice, the victims, the food, clothing
and other accompaniments of life, are all evidences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
of religious feelings and a belief in a continued existence.
The absence of the bodies in these caves
may easily be accounted for. Fleeting time with
prowling animals has destroyed them while it left
the pictures on the wall. Art is even longer than
Longfellow imagined.</p>

<p>If the earliest art so far found is religious in
origin, these so called Cro-Magnon or Aurignacian
artists exemplify again what is a commonplace in
the history of art. It would be easy to add to the
following statements found under “Art” in Hasting’s
<i>Dictionary of Religion</i>: “The religious aspect
of art in Egypt includes almost all that is known of
it.” “There is hardly any doubt that the high level
of Assyrian and Babylonian art is due to the deep
religious feeling of the two nations.” “The history
of art in Greece is throughout its course intimately
connected with religion.” The fact is beyond all
denying. Religion and art are united, in music and
song, from the dances of savages to the Hebrew
psalms and the stateliest liturgies; in painting, from
the early caveman to the modern man; in sculpture,
from the crudest icons dug up at Troy to the idol
statues of Greece and Rome, in the lions and bulls of
buried Mycenæ and Crete, of Assyria and Egypt,
in the tiny seal rings, in the ornaments and statuary
of our modern churches; in oratory, from the prayers
of the priest in the <i>Iliad</i>, to the fulminations of
the prophet and the eloquence of the pulpit; even in
civic oratory we find Demosthenes and Cicero in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
their sublimest heights touching upon religious motives;
in the poetry of incantation, of oracle, of
revelation, in liturgy and drama; in the little tale of
the fable and in the mighty story of the epic, for
the full sweep of which Homer and Virgil, Dante
and Milton must stage their events upon the background
of a Divine Providence; in architecture,
from the tombs and temples of the eastern world,
to the temples of the Aztecs and to the Gothic
cathedral.</p>

<p>Aquinas gave in his <i>Summa</i> a synthesis of all
science; Dante gave in his <i>Divina Comedia</i> a synthesis
of man’s life and destiny; the Gothic cathedral
of the same age gave a synthesis of all the arts in
one structure, exemplifying in fullness and excellence
the mutual interaction of art and religion in the
middle ages, where manifestly religion held sway
as never before or since. The Morgan “Collection”
in the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts in New
York exhibits the dusty wreckage of that wonderful
union of religion and art. No poet’s imagination
is needed to rebuild those fragments into that marvelous
structure, under whose myriad statuary of
serious saints and grotesque gargoyles, you pass
through carved portals into the spacious aisles over
which arches leap aspiringly. The painter fascinates
you with the story of many colors in the windows.
The weaver hangs other pictures on the rich tapestry
curtaining the walls. The wood-carver is everywhere
evoking beauty with cunning fingers. Music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and song in the dramatic and antiphonal liturgy,
the sublime eloquence of the pulpit in turn charm
and rest the ears.</p>

<p>The minutest detail is as artistic as the rich
magnificence. The missal on the altar will be a
“Book of Kells,” a reflection on illuminated parchment
of the religious and monastic life which produced
it, by its patience, learning, devotion, silent
application, and scrupulous exactness; “examined
with a microscope for hours,” says an authority,
“without detecting a false line or irregular interlacement.”
Near the missal of the Gothic cathedral
would be found a jeweled chalice, like that of Ardagh,
with three hundred and fifty-four distinct
pieces, classic and rich in all kinds of ornament.
Baldwin Brown was surely right in declaring: “It is
probable that nothing more artistically beautiful has
ever been seen than the Gothic cathedral,” and the
Gothic cathedral is the crowning glory of a deeply
religious age.</p>

</div>

<h4>2. THE KINSHIP OF ART AND RELIGION</h4>

<p>The history of art from its lowest manifestations
to its highest gives evidence of its union
and intimacy with religion. The fact is admitted,
and might easily be confirmed by the very way in
which religious movements violently reacted against
art. Hebraism knew the power of art over its
followers, and Hebraic antagonism to sculpture
and painting served to give religious impulse freer
outlet in Hebrew poetry and oratory and other
literature. The Bible is the supreme illustration of
the influence of religion upon literary art. Islamism
opposed art, but gradually succumbed to its influence
at least in architecture. That Islam has not yielded
more to art is an evidence of arrested civilization,
as well as of baser and more sensual religious feelings.
Puritanism, the intensest form of Protestantism,
opposed art in all its manifestations, but Puritanism
either diverted art energy to poetry and
literature or provoked excesses by its attempt to
check the natural impulses of art, and Puritanism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
finally yielded to art. It is clear then that religious
opposition to art serves but to show more strikingly
the union of religion and art. The religion that
opposes art must direct the art impulse into other
channels or the religion degenerates. By their
nature religion and art are congenial.</p>

<p>What now is the explanation of this close and continuous
union of art and religion, found everywhere
and in all ages? Taine and his school, led astray
by some details in the artist’s subject matter, have
tried to explain art by environment; but environment
is an explanation absurd in itself, and cannon
be adequate for an ubiquitous fact which transcends
all environment. The theorists who ascribe the
origin of art to play and the deploying of superfluous
energies liken, with Herbert Spencer, the art
impulse to the acts of a kitten playing with a ball.
Play may be partly an excess of energy, but not all
energy is artistic, and animal play is the stirring of
appetite, bearing but a slight, superficial resemblance
to man’s early strivings for artistic expression. How
many games are imitative and made more attractive
by art! From the very first, mind enters into early
and even child art, and at the last the devotion of
the artists to their ideals in the higher manifestations
of art, a devotion quite unlike play, shows that
the art impulse is essentially different from the instinctive
impulse of the kitten, which pounces on a
rat as it pounced on a ball of wool.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>Another school, striving to explain the connection
between art and religion, takes a directly opposite
view to the play theory. Fear and magic are,
according to these authors, the controlling factors.
The difficulty in this theory is the utterly selfish element
in the fear and magic impulse, whereas the art
impulse is disinterested and unselfish. Besides, religious
belief precedes the fear and magic propitiation
of offended powers. The voodoo and the hoodoo
mark degradations of religious impulses. Impulses
in harmony with man’s nature may go down as well
as up, and even should we suppose that the unselfish
impulse of art, which finally becomes the evidence
and glory of man’s highest civilization, could be
traced back to the sordid details of selfish superstition,
why should such an ugly duckling evolve into
a fair swan? Devolution and degradation are easier
than evolution. Why did the art impulse take the
narrow, upward path and shun the broad way down
to perdition?</p>

<p>The perfection of the oak must have been in the
potency of the acorn. The oak could not come from
a peanut, nor can all the powers of sun, rain and
soil or any other factor of the environment evolve
the fruit of the peanut vine into the majesty of the
oak. We can explain by an extrinsic cause the
stunting of an oak or the rotting of an oak, but we
cannot account for the existence of the oak—except
by an acorn. We may find perhaps a thwarted or
corrupted art tendency in superstitious fear and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
products, but that element of fear could not write a
poem or compose a sonata or rear a Gothic cathedral.
The perfection reached by the art product
must have been in the potency of the first artistic
impulse in germ.</p>

<p>Religion and art were then united potentially in
the original art impulse just as the strength and
lofty beauty of the oak were latent in the acorn.
The art impulse is natural to man; it is intellectual.
It requires brains to be artistic, as it requires brains
to laugh, and no animal has done either or will ever
do either. The bird in building its nest displays an
intelligence not its own; its nest building is inherited
just as its song is. Jean Fabre’s observations have
shown conclusively the wonders of instinct, coupled
with the stupidity of the creature possessing the instinct.
But the earliest scrawl or daub of the child
displays the mind working on matter and the deliberate
shaping of means to an end. All intellectual
testers from Simon-Binet to the latest have found
the making or interpreting of pictures a measure of
intellectual power. They are right. Art is rationalized
pigments or sounds or words with their images
or some other rationalized material. Dr. James
Harvey Robinson in <i>Mind in the Making</i> says that
we are wrong in rationalizing the past to make up
our minds, and how does he show it? By rationalizing
another past for us. The truth is we must
rationalize the past, and Dr. Robinson should induce
us, not to stop rationalizing, but to rationalize correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and should give us something better than universal
skepticism with which to rationalize. The
art tendency is one with the religious tendency in
being rational and intellectual.</p>

<p>Art and religion strive for high ideals; they are
disinterested and unselfish. LaFarge says to Saint
Gaudens: “That work is not worthy of you,” and
Saint Gaudens picks up a hammer and smashes the
sculpture. That is an instance paralleling the heroic
following of religious ideals with like sacrifices.
Was it fear of bogies or love of their dead which
filled so many tombs with precious articles? Believing
in immortality, Egyptians and Myceneans gave to
the dead what was most precious, and what was
most precious was the finest art in the costliest
material. Love keeps graves green: fear erects a
crematory.</p>

<p>Art and religion are personal and emotional.
Each has its own proper expression. Of religion
the expression is worship and of art it is concrete
embodiment of the ideal, and in both cases the expression
is intimately personal and permeated with
feeling. Art is more sensible and so more emotional
because its expression must be presented to the
senses or at least to the imagination. Religion
whose primary expression is an act of the will, need
not of its nature be attended with emotion or external
display but it usually is, and feeling and expression
commonly help to the fuller expression of
religion. The rapture of art and the ecstasy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
religion, though differing in much, have also much
in common.</p>

<p>In their social appeal art and religion are akin.
The artist and the saint have their hours of solitary
contemplation. St. Peter at Pentecost, describing
the religious ecstasy of the inspired apostles, cried
out: “These are not drunk as you suppose,” and,
continuing, he quoted the prophet Joel: “Your young
men shall see visions and your old men shall dream
dreams.” In the forming of their visions and
dreams saint and artist are alike, though the substance
of their visions differ. They are alike also
in their impulse to give their visions expression and
to influence men with them. Religion is apostolic
and art is social, and that is why in history they have
gone forth so often hand in hand to subdue the
world. Whole nations had to conspire to erect the
Egyptian pyramids, the tower of Babel, the temples
of Israel, of Rome, of Greece and of the Orient,
and the Gothic cathedrals. Only a union of art and
religion could produce such stupendous results.
Patriotism and the state have at times come near to
these great effects, when patriotism or love of country
assumed the nature of religion. To produce
these national monuments a lasting cause as well as a
cause of wide appeal was necessary. Here again art
and religion are akin. Art is long, and religion is
immortal.</p>

<p>Art reaches its highest and most perfect expression
in the sublime. Here religion does not walk hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in hand with art, but bears art on high and gives
to art some of its own divinity by endowing the artistic
expression with sublimity. The literature of the
Bible attained to heights which writers of other nations
could not dream of nor ambition. Genesis sets
poets and all artists upon a lofty eminence. By the
revelation of creation, the imagination and the vision
of the artist became coterminous almost with that
of the Creator. Newton’s theory of gravitation
which shepherded the starry hosts of the universe
into one obedient flock, gives us a realization of the
effect of Genesis upon the world’s imagination. The
creation <i>motif</i> in literature emancipating man’s imagination,
enlarging the boundaries of vision, and
dowering the artist with sublimity, deserves a
treatise by itself and a history worthy of its
greatness.</p>

<p>Art and religion are united in fact, so history
teaches; art and religion are akin, so the study of
their attributes reveals. What then is the only and
full explanation of that fact and of that harmony?
Philosophers hold that the only and the full explanation
of the harmony subsisting between the
mind and reality, which is called truth, is found in
the fact that both mind and reality are reproductions
in creation of God’s truthful knowledge of Himself.
Ethicists hold that the only and full explanation of
the harmony subsisting between the will and law,
which is called moral good, is found in the fact that
both will and law are reproductions in the finite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
God’s love of Himself. So philosophers must hold
that the full and only explanation of the harmony
subsisting between the soul and art, which is called
the expression of the beautiful, is found in the fact
that like the innate tendency to truth and good, the
tendency to beauty is a reproduction of God’s contemplation
of Himself. Creation, as has often been
declared, is a manifestation of the art of God, a
mimetic presentation in finite matter and spirit of
the infinite ideal. All advance in truth and virtue
is an approach to divine truth and goodness, and all
true progress in art is an approach to divine beauty.
“Filled with enthusiasm,” says De Wulf in <i>L’Œuvre
d’Art et la Beauté</i>, “before the greatness of the artist’s
power, Dante Alighieri compares it to that of
Omnipotence:</p>

  </div>

<p>“Art is the grand-child of God because it is the
offspring of man’s creative power as man himself
has come from the hands of God.”</p>

</div>

<h4>3. ART IN ITS RELATION TO VIRTUE</h4>

<p>The fact that religion and art are connected is
abundantly established by history. The naturalness
of that connection is made clear by the
many traits art and religion possess in common. As
philosophers have argued to the existence of God
from the fact that the universal belief in His existence
can be accounted for satisfactorily on no
other supposition; as philosophers also argue to the
immortality of the soul from man’s universal and
inevitable tendency to unending existence, so in like
manner, it may be argued that since always and
everywhere the art impulse is connected in its origin
and growth with religion, that impulse too, like
belief in God and desire of immortality and conscience
for law and tendency to truth, is a projection
of the divine upon humanity, not the anthropomorphism
of God but the theomorphism of man. The
structure of our eye, made to respond to light, justifies
us in concluding there is light. The nature of the
soul, which can respond to infinite beauty, justifies
us in concluding there is infinite beauty. He who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
said, “Let there be light,” said also, “Let us make
man after our own image and likeness.”</p>

<p>An explanation of the nature of these two human
acts of art and religion will disclose more analogies
while revealing essential differences. Religion is a
virtue of the will, a habit developed by the free act
of man, a virtue which culminates in worship of
God as the supreme being. The impulse of art has
not been analyzed as fully and as satisfactorily as
the virtue of religion, but from Aristotle’s analysis
in the <i>Poetics</i>, through the Neo-Platonists and the
Scholastics down to Kant and his followers, there is
common agreement that the tendency to beauty does
not belong to the inclination towards good, actuating
appetite and will, but that the enjoyment of beauty
is a function of the perceptions, the imagination, and
the mind. The admitted disinterestedness of the
art impulse is the paramount and irresistible evidence
that it differs essentially from the self-seeking tendency
of will and appetite which cannot be indifferent
to good, since good is the very cause and condition of
the appetite’s existence. The enjoyment of a painted
fruit is akin to the enjoyment of verified theory or
of a triumphant conclusion, and not like the satisfaction
felt in the ownership of the painting of fruit
or in the actual craving or eating of the fruit.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, why a man may be artistic
without being religious. There is no more difficulty
in understanding why an artist is not a saint than
in knowing that conscience is one thing and acting up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
to it another thing. Improvement in art does not
always mean improvement in morals or in religion,
any more than to know is to will. Nor, on the other
hand, will the evil of an artist or of his work be
evidence against the divinity of art. The divine
origin of conscience and the natural law is evident in
the vice of the sinner as in the virtues of the saint.
The essential difference between art and religion
shows also that the school in which the prophet is
Ruskin, the school which finds a religion in the
beauty of world or of art, is incorrect in its teaching.
Love and fear are the mainsprings of action,
the incentives to virtue. Beauty may grace the attraction
of good; it cannot take the place of good in
virtue and religion. Estheticism is not asceticism.
Francis of Assisi was a poet and a saint, Francesca
da Rimini enjoyed poetry, might have been a poet,
but was not always a saint, and many a Francisco
and Francesca may be found neither artistic nor
religious, as many are talented without being virtuous
and virtuous without being talented.</p>

<p>Despite the sad lack of harmony between the
beauty of their art and the virtue of their lives, artists
have nevertheless always been revered. The
honor of their art has won them in their lapses a
gentleness of treatment not accorded to less favored
mortals. They are fallen angels if they fall.</p>

<p>Does the union of religion and art mean then
that the artist must be a moralist? To moralize is
not a function of art as such. I enjoy the beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of a tree without any feeling that it conveys a truth
or inculcates a virtue. The artist may transfer the
tree to canvas, where I enjoy it as I did in nature
without any accessory implication, informing or
ethical. Joyce Kilmer may put the tree in a poem
and with it add beauty to the truth that, “only God
can make a tree.” The psalmist may put a tree in
his sacred hymn and with it add beauty to his praise
of the life of a good man, who shall be “like a tree
planted near the running waters.” Logical truth
and moral good are not excluded from art, although
the artist by profession is not a teacher. Modern
critics are often inconsistent and hypocritical in welcoming
every dramatist or poet or novelist who undisguisedly
advocates various theories, but will be
withering in their scorn for any one who advocates
the ten commandments. To moralize, to dogmatize,
to theorize is not the function of art, and though
these actions are not incompatible with the functions
of art, very rarely in the history of art has it been
successful when it undertook to teach or to preach.
Didactic poetry, satire poetry and propaganda
drama, have great difficulty in becoming poetry and
remaining poetry.</p>

<p>Religion then is a virtue of the will, resulting in
acts of worship; art, a power of the mind, resulting
in various artistic creations. Religion may remain
wholly spiritual, even in its expression, but, though
the mind’s appreciation of beauty may rest on purely
spiritual and intellectual objects, such as theories or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
virtues or God and heaven, art must express itself
in sensible objects. Even in literature, the most intellectual
of arts, words and pictures of the imagination
are essential. Angels might be conceived as
having an art whose sole medium was spiritual ideas,
not so man, whose mind works through imagination.
Aquinas, stressing the intellectual nature of beauty,
calls attention to the fact that while men speak of
beautiful sights and beautiful sounds, they will rarely
and only figuratively consider the acts of other
senses, as taste, touch and scent, beautiful. The actions
of these senses are immersed in the material,
whereas sight and hearing are closer to the intellectual
and spiritual. Man has not yet succeeded in
making a fine art whose medium would be tastes and
touches and fragrances. The unselfish enjoyment of
art cannot be released in objects so material and so
near to the appetites. The sensualist is not an
artist in yielding to sense enjoyment, although he
may wish to give his unhallowed ways an artistic
gloss. The one who sees only an apple pie in rosy
apples or senses slumbrous ease in soft velvets and
in iridescent silks or perceives only the perfume in
flower and fruit, is not experiencing esthetic emotions,
but rather stirrings of the bodily appetites.
If estheticism is not asceticism, neither is it, on the
other hand, concupiscence or mere sensualism.</p>

<p>Does the connection between art and religion exclude
the presentation of evil in art? Art would be
much handicapped if it were restricted entirely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
good objects. Art is a manifestation of man’s intellect
and must act in accord with the nature of that
faculty. If evil is artistically presented, it must be
depicted as evil. To present moral evil as a good is
a falsification as repugnant to the mind as would be
the painting of a blue sunrise, of a green moon or
of a black-and-tan sea, and as absurd as the sculpture
of a five-legged lion. The enlightened mind
rejects such physical monstrosities, and the enlightened
mind, despite the lower appetites, rejects moral
disorders with equal, if not greater, repugnance.</p>

<p>Again, art requires that the evil, the moral ugliness
or physical ugliness, be a necessary and rational
part of the presentation. A fact of nature becomes
at once the material of science, because science concerns
itself with unadorned truth. But for a fact
of nature to be material of art, it must be idealized,
that is, it must be made an integral part of the art
product. The pleasure of art does not arise from
deception but from illusion which does not deceive.
Painted grapes might deceive birds; but did they
deceive men, then the effect would not be that of art
but of reality. The evil or ugly can never be pleasant
as long as it is present and actual. The transfer
of evil to the world of art if it becomes an integral,
justified and rationalized part of the illusion, is
usually enough to rob evil of its actuality and unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Sometimes in contemporary realism, with every
justification of ugliness from the art product, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
is depression and not true art pleasure, because we
cannot forget the actual world when contemplating
the imaginary world of art. Suppose “Macbeth”
or “Œdipus” were really historical and were acted
in the presence of their contemporaries or of the
next generation. Would there be satisfaction and
the emotional relief arising from illusion? Hardly.
Memories would be too much lacerated with the actual
to surrender to the illusion of art and to enjoy
its contemplation. Actuality would put back the salt
into the tears that else might have been sweetened
by transfer of evil to remote and imaginary realms.
The Greeks and Shakespeare were right in making
their tragedies historical, whereas modern realists
are somber with pessimism because they never forsake
the actual.</p>

<p>Art and religion are both concerned with life and
so they both must touch evil and ugliness, unhappily
a large part of life. Religion as a virtue
must overcome evil and not permit it to master the
will. Art depicts evil in such a way as not to offend
the enlightened mind, by approval of evil or by the
artistically unjustified introduction of evil or by actual
experience of evil. In all these cases the mind
would not experience the true and lasting pleasure
of art. The taste of fruit passes; the contemplation
of painted fruit is a joy forever. Art pleasure is
not the playing with toys, as Plato would seem to
make it, but the fine occupation of rational minds,
which Aristotle made it, an occupation worthy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
man because art interprets nature and man to himself,
because art exercises man’s rational faculties,
because art releases man’s emotions under conditions
where the evil of actual life is removed. Macbeth
and Œdipus in life were saddening spectacles; the
echo of that sadness felt through dramatic representation
has high pleasure for the mind.</p>

<p>The cathartic function of art brings it close to
the virtuous and the divine. What virtue does
really, art does ideally, transforming evil into good.
The vicarious sacrifice of Calvary was the catharsis
of mankind, an infinite cleansing, compared with
which the vicarious feeling of dramatically enacted
evil is but as a drop to the ocean. Close to the divine,
too, although at the same time infinitely
remote, is the creation of art. Wisdom and love
inspired God in His creation, but so also did the
quest of beauty. Aquinas called the universe God’s
sermon, and the universe is a divine picturing and
sculpturing and harmonizing. The artist follows
far after, rethinking through finite images the ideals
which filled the thoughts of the Divine Artist.</p>

<p>In idealizing, in creating, is art akin to the divine,
and, lastly, in its disinterestedness is art divine. All
appreciation of beauty is divine. Contemplation
will be the occupation of eternity, and contemplation
is the proper and the congenial attitude of the soul
towards beauty. Good inspires love and attracts to
union, but when union has been effected in eternity,
the enraptured ecstasy of the beautiful will be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
soul’s unending activity. Beauty is the supreme excellence
of truth, the polish on the granite of fact,
the uncloying fascination arrested upon perfection.
In eternity infinite good and infinite truth, obscured
in time, will stream into the soul unclouded and refulgent,
and beauty will grace love and crown
wisdom.</p>

<p>The millions of mankind who admire the red of
every morning, and the forests breaking green
through the silver mists and the birds in awakened
song rising from the flowers to the brightening sky,
these millions do not begrudge one another such
beautiful spectacles, nor are they mutually jealous
as they listen to beautiful sounds. That unselfish,
that unenvious contemplation of beauty marks off
man from animals by an impassable chasm and makes
him an image of the self-sufficing Creator, the source
of all beauty, the exemplar of all beauty, whom the
Blessed forever contemplate and forever enjoy, unenvying
and unenviously.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VISCERAL TEST OF BEAUTY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>“What is the prime requisite of a critic?”
was the question. “His sincerity,” said
one; “his sympathy,” said a second; “his philosophy,”
said a third, “because everything he says
will be ruled by his principles, even his sincerity and
sympathy.” The answer of the third speaker is
pertinent to a symposium printed in the <i>New Republic</i>
on the function of criticism.</p>

<p>It is the common view of the seven writers that
criticism is an art and the critics, artists, but no one,
except Mr. Francis Hackett, tries to show what the
label of artist means. Mr. Dickinson Miller, a professor
in a theological seminary, very justly and
quite fittingly insists on the social responsibility of
the artist, as one who deals with life. Mr. Lovett
goes to history and prepares the ground for a discussion
of principles by grouping critics in several
classes. Mr. Clive takes the humblest and most
practical view of the critic, calling him an appraiser,
a function which Mr. H. L. Mencken vehemently
repudiates and places a chip on his shoulder while
belligerently proclaiming himself impressionistic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
He makes one deep remark which would seem to
put him in the same school of esthetics with Mr.
Hackett. Presumably with humorous intent, or perhaps
seriously, Mr. Mencken locates the artistic
impulse in “hormones and intestinal flora.” Hormones
are secretions of the glands (we just looked it
up!) and “intestinal flora” may mean ferments.
Mr. Mencken is abreast of the times. Graft on a
new gland and masticate yeast, these are the new
specifics for all the ills that flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>The other contributors to this interesting symposium,
though not, with the exception of Mr.
Hackett, delving as deep as Mr. Mencken, would
appear to be in philosophy individualists and subjectivists.
The former editor of the <i>Athenæum</i>,
Mr. J. Middleton Murry, accepts the dictum of
Rémy de Gourmont: “Erect personal impressions
into laws,” as the “true motto of a critic.” Mr.
Murry is, however, too sensible to accord to individual
impressions undue freedom and with some
violence to his consistency asserts that personal laws
stand or fall by their agreement with common experience
and with human nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris Cohen puts himself into a fallacious
dilemma from which he does not successfully extricate
himself. According to Mr. Cohen, all critics
are led by personal impressions or by the authority
of others. He should know that between the blind
feeling of impressionism and the blind faith of authority
there is enlightened reason. Mr. Cohen does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
not take the path of reason, but endeavors to escape
the horns of his own dilemma by recourse to pragmatism.
He claims, what will be news to historians
of philosophy, that Euclid was the first pragmatist,
although in the next breath Mr. Cohen states that
“mathematicians of the nineteenth century have
shown that Euclid’s axioms are mere guesses to be
justified by their consequences in the factual realm.”
“Factual realm” seems to mean the indefinitely remote
future of pragmatism where the gold of truth
is separated from meaner elements. Some chosen
spirits of the “factual realm” now assure us that the
“self-evident principles” of Euclid are “guesses.”
Mr. Cohen is equipped to write an inside history of
philosophy with some entirely original features.
The “factual realm” leads back to skepticism, and
Mr. Cohen is still impaled by his dilemma.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Hackett makes the most serious attempt
to get at the philosophy of criticism and of
art, and attacks at once the question of the beautiful.
It is evidence of his thoroughness that he goes
straightway to the great problem of esthetics, “Can
an object be at once beautiful and evil?” Mr.
Hackett answers promptly in the negative, but then
proceeds to confuse the point by going to another
and different question, “Can evil or an ugly object
be represented in art?” The answer to this question
is evident. The elopement of Helen, the patricide
and incest of Œdipus, the galleries of Dante’s Inferno
and Purgatorio, and countless other happenings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
in the world of art, show that the evil and the
ugly have been and may be represented in art. “I
can hardly conceive,” says Mr. Hackett, “an artist
as subduing a cancerous object to an esthetic design.”
But why not? Marriage with one’s mother is more
repugnant than a cancer, and yet it was handled successfully
by Sophocles, however repulsive some of his
imitators have been in their details.</p>

<p>The very transfer to the realm of art robs the
ugly object of its actuality and imminence. Surely
the ugly and evil have been and may be represented
in art, but such objects may not be represented as
beautiful and good. That were as false and untrue
to nature as a centipede cow in a picture. Perhaps
a cancer could not appear in a picture or poem or
story except by suggestion. A stark realism would
disgust, but a true artist might subdue a cancerous
object to artistic design as effectively as Homer subdued
in his story the fleas of the dog, Argos, and
the dung-heap where he lay.</p>

<p>Beauty in art would lose one of its charms, the
splendor of contrast, did not admitted ugliness or
evil occur in art. Bad art disgusts and so does badness
in art, when badness is approved or when it is
projected into art for purposes not artistic. Mr.
Hackett’s real trouble is that he has not properly
isolated the feeling of art awakened by beauty. He
thinks that the esthetic sense is sexual and visceral.
If the mouth waters at painted fruit, would Mr.
Hackett call art salival? Human beings are composites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and external objects while producing their
essential and proper effects may have concomitant
effects accidentally brought into being. To admire
the beauty of an apple is an esthetic feeling entirely
distinct in cause and faculty and in operation from
the feeling of sensible satisfaction, anticipated or
actual, which comes to the taste-buds, and different
again from any visceral qualms that may arise from
associated ideas of unhappy experience with other
apples.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackett has been led astray by not distinguishing
the disinterested emotions of beauty from
the selfish emotions of appetite. He calls beauty,
“disinterested satisfaction,” and in that word “disinterested”
he has a fact about beauty, a fact solving
his problems, a fact which has been admitted by
every one who has studied the subject, and a fact
which is capable of experimental demonstration at
any moment. Professor Phelps of Yale once called
esthetic emotions a spinal thrill; Mr. Mencken
would call them “hormones or intestinal flora”; and
Mr. Hackett declares that “the true sources of
esthetic satisfaction and dissatisfaction are deep in
our emotional and visceral life.” The one essential
quality of disinterestedness, found in esthetic satisfaction,
shows the absurdity of all such statements.
Bodily emotions are all the outcome of appetites,
and appetites are never disinterested but always self-seeking
by their very nature. They are actuated by
good; they tend to an end, an end which they do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
not and cannot seek disinterestedly. Even the act
of the highest disinterested love may be akin to the
sense of beauty, but it is not as wholly disinterested
because that unselfish love is still seeking good, and
good as such does not come within the purview of
beauty at all. It is impossible to be disinterested
towards good or evil.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackett speaks of beauty being a “sensuous
satisfaction.” Here again there is a confusion between
beauty of art and other beauty. Art appeals
to the senses because art presents its beauty in concrete
embodiments. To that extent the satisfaction
of beauty arises from sensible objects, but the feeling
of beauty transcends mere sensation. “Art is
long.” “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” The
satisfaction of appetite is passing; the satisfaction
of beauty abides. Mr. Hackett does well to seek
the springs of beauty in personality. Personality is
an abiding principle of intellectual beings. The enduring
joy of beauty argues to an abiding principle
which bears the dynamic charge of that joy. Beauty
supposes a soul.</p>

<p>“Beauty is a light that may follow any reality
whatever and give us the power to release our emotions
happily in the presence of that reality.” So
states Mr. Hackett, and he is right, if he gives the
correct meaning to “emotions.” Light or luster
has been recognized from all time as an objective
element of beauty, which has been defined as the
light of truth. Mr. Hackett paraphrases a definition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
which has been incorrectly attributed to Plato.
Kleutgen has defined beauty as the perfection of anything
resplendently manifested.</p>

<p>Let us hope that Mr. Hackett will remove “visceral”
from among the qualities of beauty and preclude
critics from adding a fiftieth explanation of
Aristotle’s <i>catharsis</i> to the forty-nine varieties already
set forth. Wearers of Murphy buttons or
those who have lost or may lose sections of the intestinal
tract should be assured in an amended edition
of Mr. Hackett’s esthetics that their sense of beauty
has not been abbreviated or impaired. Sane
philosophy is the prime requisite of true criticism.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">LOOKING FORWARD IN LITERATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The teacher of literature today is looking backward
when he should be looking forward.
Greek literature, Latin literature and, to a large
extent, English literature are not orientated; they
do not face the rising sun. It was not so in the Greek
schools of Greek literature. Gorgias and Isocrates
taught literature for the morrow, and for practical
and immediately practical purposes. In the Roman
schools it was so from first to last. Recall Cicero’s
studies under Greek rhetoricians and Cicero’s own
preachment in the <i>Archias</i> speech. “Shame on those
who bury themselves so deep in literature that they
harvest nothing for the good of all and bring nothing
to light for our eyes to look upon.” Recall
Quintilian’s <i>Institutes of Oratory</i>, and all the intervening
schools of Rome. Rome had no vocational
schools for road-building, but Rome did have schools
of grammar, poetry, rhetoric and philosophy where
it trained leaders with vision and with the power
to act. The brains of Rome trained in literature
guided barbarian hands to lay down the roads over
which Christianity traveled and civilization came
down to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>Literature looked forward in every period of the
world’s schooling. Ausonius and Isidore, Alcuin and
Petrarch, Boileau and Pope, England and France,
and even Germany until about the middle of the
nineteenth century and America until a little later,
kept the literatures of Greece and Rome orientated
to the future by teaching them as arts, by making
composition of literature the goal of the teaching of
literature.</p>

<p>Science is ever growing old; history is always
being rewritten; literature is ever young. We know
more about Homer’s history than Longinus knew,
but we do not taste the delight of his poetry any
better than Longinus tasted it. “Handing on the
torch of learning” is a trite phrase, but it is literally
verified in the true teaching of literature. Each
age adds to the advance of science and information,
but art is long. Literature and art do not belong to
the past. Literally and without figure of speech they
are the past living in the present. They are the
flaming torch, kindled in the past, never dimming
and never to dim.</p>

<p>Write a history of artists; do not write a history
of art. “A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” The
information of science changes every moment; the
appreciation of art once gained is enduring. The
<i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> has rewritten all its science
and history; it reprints its appreciations of Sophocles
by Campbell and of Demosthenes by Jebb and even
of Johnson by Macaulay. Where the cause is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
same, the effect is the same, and so the beauty of
Homer’s rosy-fingered dawn awakens still the same
appreciation.</p>

<p>Of literature as a subject of investigation in
university or graduate work there is here no question.
The investigator studies the origin, the development,
the history of literature. He looks backward;
his purpose is to amass information and to
codify a science. That is not or should not be the
purpose of the teacher in high school and college.
He is educating; he wishes to set in operation and
perfect the faculties of the class before him, to impress
upon every faculty its own proper art, that is,
its habitual and excellent way of acting. The school
teacher is concerned with the education of acts; the
university lecturer with the education of facts.</p>

<p>Take the <i>Ratio Studiorum</i> of the Jesuits, a system
embodying the traditions of education and not differing
fundamentally from other systems of its time.
The <i>Ratio Studiorum</i> had no history of literature
or lectures on the evolution of literature. It did
not approach literature as a science but as an art. It
took the standard authors of Latin and Greek.
Cicero was the staple of every class in Latin because
for nearly every kind of Latinity, history and poetry
excepted, he was a model. Cicero was analyzed,
was appreciated, was imitated, that the student
might express himself in writing and speaking as
clearly, as interestingly, as forcibly as Cicero, that
the student might be master of acts of literature, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of facts about literature. That was and is humanism;
that is, making a man a man by equipping all
his faculties with the art proper to each. The humanities
were so called because they embody man.
Science is classified nature; literature is nature
brought into touch with man’s personality and transmuted
into art, man’s only creation.</p>

<p>You cannot get grapes from thorns or figs from
thistles. Every other subject in the curriculum produces
its kind; so should literature. Mathematics
makes mathematicians, chemistry chemists, and physics
physicists. Art should produce artists; literature
should result in literature, in artistic expression,
but it is made to produce historians, biographers,
perhaps critics. The history of literature,
the evolution of literature should be put out of high
school and college and relegated to the university
or handed over to the lectures on history, leaving
the valuable time of literature for appreciation and
expression.</p>

<p>Today we have literature in one class and composition
in another and perhaps rhetoric in another.
Departments are the offspring of universities and
the instruments of science. The rational school of
literary expression correlates author, precept and
exercise. Information may be imparted piecemeal
and from different sources; it is multitudinous and
capable of division. Formation is one and united;
it is the faculty or power brought to the perfection
of self-expression. Art requires a teacher and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
unifying of means; science may have a score of lecturers
as its truths are found in a score of books.
Let the teacher of literature therefore take standard
literature, make it understood, feel its personality
that students may feel it, note and appreciate its
beauty that others may take fire or at least get heat
from the enthusiasm kindled within him, and then
let the teacher see to it that his class express their
own selves as the author expressed himself. Let
students do for Lincoln what Shakespeare did for
Julius Cæsar. If they cannot do a play, perhaps
they can do an act; if they cannot create a character,
perhaps they can give one characteristic action; if
they cannot write a description or tell a story, perhaps
they can supply a noun for Lincoln or visualize
his deeds in a verb or paint him in an epithet or
coin him in a metaphor. And all this, not for an
Elizabethan public, but for the students’ own public
here and now, looking forward, not backward.</p>

<p>Desperate efforts have been made to galvanize
literary courses by lectures on modern novels, current
magazines and daily papers. The lamentable
fact is that most recent products are not literature;
that if there is in them art, it has not been made
available for students, as the art of literary classics
has been made available by centuries of criticism,
and that, finally, the contents of contemporary writings
are so easy of access and so inviting to the
reader and yet often so ephemeral, that the artistic
form is neglected. There is no contemporary history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
neither is there contemporary criticism. Literature,
like all art, must pass beyond the prejudices
and passions of the day to be known and appreciated
as art at all. It is for the enlightened teacher of
literature to make the students embody their own
experience in the finest art molds of the past, not
distracting them by the multiplicity of modern literature,
but holding up the ideals, like torches, to light
the paths before them and, like expert guides, to
direct the trembling steps of beginners to new goals.</p>

<p>Literature is not the study of words. Grammar
or philology is the study of words. Science dehumanizes
everything; it eliminates the personal
equation; it is objective, unimpassioned, impersonal,
subordinating everything to laws and principles.
Literature is the opposite in every respect. It is
embodied humanity. Science contains some of man’s
operations; literature enshrines all; not truth alone,
but good and beauty as well; not simply the clear
idea, the accurate statement, the correct conclusion,
the consistent reasoning, but also the myriad visions
of the imagination, the subtle analogies, the suggestive
creations, haunting beauties and idealized good.
So literature actuates every power of man whether
that power is a constituent part of man’s soul or is
a bodily power whose operation by reaction terminates
in man’s soul.</p>

<p>As literature is therefore the whole man, so far as
humanity can be put in language, the understanding
of literature, its appreciation and most of all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
creation will make every power of the student operate,
if literature is taught as literature. Such results
will not come automatically; they come when the
teacher by true appreciation creates again before
the student the literary masterpiece and when the
student strives to rival the masterpiece in the expression
of his own experience and of his own dawning
humanity. Literature is looking forward when
it is making minds think and imaginations imagine
and reasons reason and tastes taste and emotions
thrill. Teach literature as an art, which it is; not
as a science, which it is not.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="X">X<br />
<span class="smaller">UNIFYING EDUCATION THROUGH LITERATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Unity is most useful, if not essential, to a satisfactory
course of studies. In the university this
unity is effected by the profession which the student
has chosen. His field of concentration in art,
literature, law, medicine, science, engineering or
divinity dictates to him his subjects, and his own
earnest choice, together with prescriptions and examinations,
insures unity and thoroughness in concentration
courses.</p>

<p>Lecturing is the predominant method of the university
because professors of higher branches are
few and students are comparatively numerous. Lecturing
is the weakest and most ineffective of all
means of education, and is only saved from complete
failure by the serious purposes of university
students and much more by the sanction of
repetitions and examinations.</p>

<p>In the colleges, however, with the advent of electivism
there was no unifying bond to the studies.
University methods of studies and lectures prevailed
where there were no university conditions. Thoroughgoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
electivists, like Dr. Eliot, admitted that
the purpose of the college was a general education
or culture, but held that any and every study could
give such general training. President Lowell, Dr.
Eliot’s successor, began to put order into the chaos
of extreme electivism. He saw his coaches on the
athletic fields build up expert athletes by a rigidly
prescribed course of training, and proclaimed the
analogy between body and mind, an analogy which
would have been all the more cogent had his philosophy
been materialistic like that of Dr. Eliot.
The prescribed examination in one department at
the end of four years is the latest advance of Harvard
toward definiteness and unity.</p>

<p>All colleges in America took up electivism to some
extent, and even where studies were still prescribed
they adopted in their catalogs the language and
methods of electivism. No longer were there
classes, but everywhere you had courses and departments.
One effect of this system has been to make
coördinate and of equal importance many subjects
which had formerly been subordinate. Colleges
whose major subject, or field of concentration, had
been language, with other subjects subordinate, now
tended to make every subject a major and every
field a field of concentration. The departmental
system has helped to impair unity of education by
disturbing the hierarchy of studies and by removing
all subordination. It does not appear to be feasible
to concentrate on everything. In some cases colleges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
seem about to give up the general-training idea
and are tending to make their whole course subservient
to a profession, obliging every one to take a
pre-medical course because the American Medical
Association is mighty and medical schools are very
exacting.</p>

<p>Formerly high schools and colleges made language
or self-expression the field of concentration, and
other subjects, like history, mathematics, sciences,
were kept subordinate. College and high school
had then one purpose, which unified all their studies,
as a profession unified lectures in the university—that
purpose was the mastery of the art of expression.
The French lycées, the German gymnasia,
the English public schools, the Jesuit <i>Ratio Studiorum</i>,
prepared for the university by making students
masters of writing and speaking. The writer
and speaker could express himself; his intellectual
faculties could work properly, and therefore they
had received a general training which prepared them
for professional work of a special kind. The field
of concentration was shown in the names of the
classes. The teachers were teachers, not of Latin,
Greek, English, but of grammar, of poetry, of oratory,
of clear, interesting, forceful expression.</p>

<p>The departmental system destroys this fine unity
or renders it very difficult of attainment. The departmental
system has been perhaps the chief reason
why the classics have been taught as means towards
the acquisition of various sciences rather than as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
exemplifications of literary art. It is as literature
and as models of perfect expression that the classics
have hitherto survived; as literature and models of
expression they were taught in the days preceding
the university system of departments. Cicero was a
model of letter-writing, of essay-writing, of speech-making.
He was chosen with a view to composition;
he was graded with a view to composition.</p>

<p>How can a department teacher preserve the
former unity of system, where all literature was
studied with one dominating purpose, self-expression?
If the grade of the class is rhetoric or oratorical
expression, will each department teach its
own authors, Greek, Latin and English, following
the same rhetorical precepts in the same order, or
will each department follow its own terminology
and its own order, or will, as has happened everywhere,
the teaching of rhetoric be relegated to
English or to a separate professor, leaving Cicero
and Demosthenes to be taught as grammatical
documents or historical documents or as legal documents,
not as speeches, not as models of oratorical
expression? Will the professor of Latin teach
Virgil as epic poetry, and the professor of Greek
teach Homer as epic poetry, and the professor of
English teach Milton as epic poetry, or will the
teaching of poetry be avoided by the Greek and
Latin departments entirely? Cicero and Demosthenes
survive because they are orators; Homer
and Virgil live because they are epic poets, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
departmental system either forgets that fact entirely
or has three professors teaching the same
thing with confusion in the order and in the rules
of art. The departmental system, which is a university
device adapted for specialization, makes
unity of education extremely difficult, and has taken
all the interest out of literature by teaching it as
everything else but literature!</p>

<p>Besides, as art is the power of doing, and science
is chiefly systematized information, the process of
education for doing will be different from the process
of acquiring information. Too many cooks
may spoil the broth because cooking is an art, but
too many sign-posts may not always confuse the
traveler. It is far easier to divide information
among various agents and impart it piecemeal than
to apportion the different faculties used in an art
to different individuals who will train them to act
together harmoniously. Different teachers may
very well teach the geography of different countries,
but it would not be feasible to let one teacher
have the right hand and another the left in teaching
the art of piano-playing.</p>

<p>Omitting the effect of personality, which is paramount
in art, as the history of all religious movements
shows it also to have been in the formation
of character and in virtue, one cannot fail to see
that departments cannot well coöperate in giving
the formation of art. In fact, practically the art
of composition has ceased to be the field of concentration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
in modern high schools and colleges. All
literatures, even English, are taught mostly as
sciences. The only wholesome reaction in modern
education against the predominance of science or
systematized information is found in the present
vogue for psychological tests. These are professedly
tests of power, not of mere information,
and in them the power of self-expression through
language is preëminent. All the examinations are
conditioned by the necessary medium of language,
and by far the greater number of tests are and must
always be tests in linguistic expression.</p>

<p>Language is the only practical measure of intelligence,
and if such tests win favor, they may result
in establishing once more the art of expression
as the field of concentration or major subject in high
schools and colleges which give a general education.
Language, when taught as an art, educates the mind,
giving it the powers of expression which are the
guaranties of the mind’s adequate education. Professors
become teachers of an art, not lecturers in
a science. Perfect unity is found where the finest
models of self-expression in all languages, especially
the classical languages, are directed by one teacher
to the mastery of the art of expression in one’s
own language.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INTERESTING TEACHER OF LITERATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The nineteenth century was a century of science.
Its atmosphere was surcharged with scientific
discoveries and scientific theories, and radiated a
scientific influence in every direction. Among other
effects of that all-pervading spirit we may mention
two that entered the classroom and deeply modified
the teaching of literature. Science insisted on concrete
results and tended to emphasize mechanical
methods, enhancing system at the expense of
personality.</p>

<p>System was looked upon in some sense as automatic.
Such a widespread delusion, which is not
yet fully dissipated, was the logical outcome of the
mechanical explanation of the universe. The world
had evolved along the lines of inflexible laws.
Man was part of the machine, and though the
mechanism was complicated in his case, yet it was
nothing but mechanism after all. If system could
run the universe without the help of personality, it
would not be hard for it to run the little universe
of man. The same reasoning would hold in a classroom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
The teacher might be asked to touch the
button, but the system would do the rest.</p>

<p>It would not seem to require much argumentation
to show the fallacy of such a theory. Do we
not all know that nothing in this world is wholly
automatic? Motion is a function of personality.
Perpetual motion in systems and organizations,
that would dispense with personality, is just as absurd
as the same proposal in the physical order.
Nothing in this world will run of itself without personal
coöperation. Somewhere there must be a
living, breathing, responsible individual. We may
have to travel a long way to find him, but we shall
find him, the man behind the motion. It is so with
machines; it is much more so with organizations
and systems and laws; it is most of all so in education.
Latin or German or physics or anything else
without a teacher (cf. catalog of correspondence
schools) are phrases that belong to the language of
advertisement which has omitted from its ethics the
chapter on lying. All success, all interest, all enthusiasm
are harvests whose sowing is in a human
head or human heart. Even the universe calls for
the constantly applied force of omnipotence to keep
it from disintegrating into nothingness and the
watchfulness of Providence to prevent it from wrecking
itself. While writers on education have been
tracing the causes of the decrease of interest in the
classics have they not been overlooking the necessary
factor of personality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>The other depressing effect upon education exercised
by the scientific atmosphere was the insistence
upon concrete results, leading likewise to the elimination
of human interest. Science said to every
branch of knowledge, “Collect your data, classify
your instances, make your deductions, enunciate
your laws.” The literary classics were bade to
stand and deliver. They had to have data and deductions
and laws. Homer and Virgil, Demosthenes
and Cicero became the chosen camping-ground
of the specialists. The pupils that finished
the <i>Iliad</i> with a taste developed, an imagination
warmed, a soul uplifted, might be refused a degree.
The pupil who had Homer undergo the surgical
operations of specialism, who had him pigeon-holed,
who had him weighed and counted, was the honor
man of the class. He could write an essay on
Homeric Æolisms or Homeric ship-building or
Homeric word-building. He knew more about Homeric
pottery than Homeric poetry. What if
his heart never beat faster as he read; what if he
was too busy measuring the length of Homeric
swords or analyzing the metal of Homeric
armor, to drink in the imaginative delight of battle,
with Homeric peers, “far on the ringing plains of
windy Troy,” he was scientific, he had some concrete
results to show for his schooling, and he was
the pet child of the century. Assets of the mind
could not be weighed or measured; his doctor’s dissertation
in his grip could. It contained just twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
thousand words, and weighed one pound and a
half, and had a superficial area of about a hundred
square yards.</p>

<p>The final outcome of the baneful influence of the
scientific atmosphere is the almost complete perversion
of the good old word, scholar. No one can
lay claim now to the title scholarly, unless he is
equipped with a formidable array of facts and
figures. He must bristle with the fretful quills
of half a hundred sciences. In the study of the
classics he is so busy with the words of the text that
he has not time for their meaning. When he has
settled the conflicting claims of innumerable variant
readings and all the arguments for the same, he
has no leisure left for the old-fashioned practice
of trying to appreciate the accepted reading. Scholarship
is now a matter of memory, a something that
deals with introductions, footnotes, excursuses and
critical apparatuses. Plead guilty to an ignorance
of all this, and you may be indulgently permitted to
call yourself judicious, appreciative, discerning,
capable of enjoying a literary masterpiece, but you
could not presume to call yourself scholarly. Justin
McCarthy, in an article about his old schoolmaster,
alludes to the same fact. “I never knew a
scholar,” he declares, “so thorough who was less
of a pedant, but I ought to say, perhaps, that the
general character of his teaching was not what
would be called in our days scholarly.”</p>

<p>This steady elimination of the subjective element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
of education with the corresponding development
of the objective side during the years of the
nineteenth century, all tended to the extinction of
the individual. Another factor also coöperated in
achieving this result. The classes in school and college
grew more numerous, and the schoolmaster became
in turn a teacher, a professor, a lecturer.
With each change he drew further away from his
hearers. The greater the audience the weaker the
personal note, the less individual the expression.
The lecturer on a classical author must stray more
from the text than the teacher. He is necessarily
more general and hence more impersonal. He feels
bound to give facts more than impressions. He is
committed to the formulating of theories based on
a dissection of the text, and shrinks from setting
forth the feelings which a masterpiece excites. The
lecturer tends to subordinate the author to his lecture,
where the teacher’s more humble lot leads him
to efface himself in the presence of the author.</p>

<p>This leads us to set forth the proper attitude of
the teacher toward the text, and we could not begin
the discussion better than by giving a further
description of Justin McCarthy’s old schoolmaster.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have,” he wrote, in March, 1899, “the most delightful and
tender memories of my dear old schoolmaster in Cork. He was
not, indeed, the first schoolmaster I ever had, but he taught me
all or put me in the way of learning all that I have ever known,
and after this long lapse of time I feel as strongly as ever how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
much I owe him. His name was John Goulding, and he kept a
school in the city of Cork, my birthplace.</p>

<p>“To make us understand what we were reading and enjoy it,
to make us wish to read more and understand it better—such
was the object of his whole method. There was very little of
what is called ‘getting by heart’ in his system, unless when he
wished to train memory merely for the sake of training it.
When we were studying some Latin author he told us all about
the author and the scenes described in the pages before us, and
he invited all manner of questions on the subject. He showed
us on the maps where the places were which the author was
describing, and he illustrated the author’s meaning as if he were
an artist illustrating a story.</p>

<p>“I do not know to describe his method of teaching better
than by saying that it was literary rather than scholastic. His
great desire was that a boy should be able to read Greek and
Latin as easily as he read Shakespeare and Addison, and he
regarded grammar as a necessary means to that end, but not as
the end itself. He always took care that historical and geographical
knowledge should work in with and illustrate our
literary studies.</p>

<p>“I can only say for myself that whatever love of books I may
have had I owe in the main to his teaching and to his influence,
and I can say with literal truthfulness that throughout a busy
life in public and in private his influence and teaching have
always been with me and are with me still.”</p>

</div>

<p>John Goulding would not be considered in our
day a remarkable pedagogist and has not bequeathed
his name to a system of education; yet
he presents many traits of the true teacher, and
these details of his life are pertinent to our question.</p>

<p>The true commentator, whose suggestion we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
in the Cork schoolmaster, will not be a philologist,
but will use philology; he will not be a grammarian,
but he will refuse no point of grammar that will
help. He will press every science into service, but
he will be the slave of none. He will remember
that his supreme object in teaching is not to compose
a dictionary of antiquities nor to collect extracts
for rhetoric or examples for grammar. His
object rather is and should be to bring the pupil to
the text, to bring the mind of the author to the mind
of the reader. Away from dictionary and grammar,
away from footnote and appendix, back to the
text, should be the teacher’s cry. The text should
be the center upon which every source of information
should be focused, not the center from which
to radiate to the cheerless circumference of specializations.
We do not contend for superficiality, for
slipshod grammar, for inaccurate erudition. Thoroughness,
care, accuracy, must rule in the classroom.
We are simply for liberal education, which opposes
early specialization in courses and must equally oppose
it in the teaching of literature.</p>

<p>The study of the classics should key up the whole
intellectual apparatus. It should sharpen the critical
faculties, warm the imagination, cultivate the
judgment, develop the taste, ennoble the appreciation,
exercise, partially at least, the reasoning
faculty, and finally endow the student with perfected
powers of expression. To subordinate literature to
any one of the swarm of sciences that sprang into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
life last century is to limit its efficiency and degrade
it as a means of general culture.</p>

<p>The teacher, however, must not look for an infallible
recipe in this matter. He cannot expect
to stir up interest in the pupils by any prescribed
formula, by a rigid system of handling the text. A
scheme of suggestions may be drawn up, topics for
discussion or observation may be arranged. Such
devices are helpful, but they should not become
stereotyped, because they deaden when they are
hard and fast. It is a mark of a crystal to settle
into straight lines at fixed angles; it is characteristic
of organisms to be yielding and pliable in their
outlines, while they retain their life. The meaning
is the life of the text, the meaning as it was in the
author’s mind, with all the associations that it had
for him. Let the meaning be the guide, and the
explanation will not be dead. Let the teacher use
systems and hints and topics and all other devices
as helps to arrive at the sense and meaning, not as
inflexible molds into which he must always pour his
commentary. A chemist may have weighed and
labeled all the constituent elements of a living cell,
and he may even succeed in mingling them in such
a way as to have all these elements in the very
places they are in life, but his mixture will not have
the principle of life, that wonderful, unanalyzable
bond that unites into one organism, permeates and
vivifies the separate atoms and molecules. Because
his analysis is complete and perfect, it does not follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
that his synthesis will be complete and perfect.
Neither may a teacher expect to get the synthesis
of a vital, interesting commentary from the detailed
formula of the literary laboratory. He must have
his finger on the pulse; he must have seized the beating,
warm heart; he must have grasped the permeating,
vivifying soul of his author, if he would
make his commentary living, and there is no other
way to the heart blood of an author, except by loving,
enthusiastic meditation of his full meaning.</p>

<p>I remember the first time in class that Homer
ceased to be for me an example factory for grammar
or a shop for Grecian antiquities. We had been
translating Homer and parsing Homer; we now
began to read him. The change was as easy as it
was pleasant. The teacher simply went back behind
the dictionary and the grammar, behind the
cases and the tenses, to the author’s meaning. He
made us see the old priest of Apollo walking along
the seashore. He made us realize the fact that he
was coming to speak for his daughter. Our attention
was called to the completeness and appropriateness
of his little speech. In a word, we began to
move in the poet’s world. We had used the grammar
and dictionary to get there, but when we
reached our destination, we alighted from the train.
We were bound for the land of Homer, not for that
of Goodwin or Liddell &amp; Scott, and the sooner we
left our dusty, noisy cars, the better for us. Our professor
knew the translation and knew the grammar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
but he had left them behind him. He was on higher
levels, and he threw away his mountain staff and
his guide rope. We were with him there, and we
entered into his enthusiasm for the broad view before
us. Homer had been for us a venerable mausoleum
of well-preserved and dignified, but very
dead mummies. His enthusiasm let the life and
light into that ancient tomb, and the mummies took
off their wraps and lived and moved. From that
day of resurrection until the present, Homer has
lived for me; from that time I have heard the
Homeric heart beat and felt the Homeric pulse
throb.</p>

<p>Nor need the teacher who follows these methods
have fear that he is going wrong, or that he is
neglecting the proper education of his pupils. He
is achieving, too, concrete results, an achievement
that must not be considered the monopoly of science.
Science may not supplant literature in the school-room.
It would be a sad day for both if ever it
did. As regards observation and induction, it has
not been our wish to protest against the use of these
methods, but rather against the limiting of their
scope. To observe grammar only or archeology or
philology and neglect the author’s meaning is as
ridiculous as to observe the paint and not the picture,
to put a microscope to the marble and not
notice the statue. We do not want less development,
rather we want more. Develop the powers
of observation, but do not think that the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
powers are the senses. The world of imagination
and the world of thought offer wider fields for observation
than the world of external sense. The
horizon of the mind is not restricted to the sky line
that narrows the vision of the eye.</p>

<p>If you train the powers of observation in the laboratory
by asking the pupil to see, to touch, to taste,
to smell, train them, too, in the classroom, by asking
them to listen to the harmony of a sentence, to
trace out the development of a thought, to appreciate
the wit, the beauty, the sublimity of a passage.
There was observation and training of the
powers of observation before the test tube was
blown or the dynamo was wound. Science has
opened up new and wonderful worlds, not one of
which would we see closed; but the lands of literature
have not ceased for that reason to be inviting,
and the soul, wearied with facts and hampered with
figures, gladly escapes into the restful regions of
higher and ampler realities.</p>

<p>The crossing of the borders of mere expression,
the living and moving in the realms of meaning, the
appreciative following of an author’s mind in all
journeyings, may not develop grammarians or philologists
or ethnologists or archeologists. Perhaps
it is not the life-work of classical literature to stock
the market with such commodities. The student
who travels with a master-mind through the land
of thought, now captivated with a view just under
his eyes, again catching a glimpse of some far-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
scene, all the more glorious in promise, because it
lacks definiteness of detail, such a one may turn out
to be more of a tourist than a local antiquarian and
may suffer some inconveniences in consequence. He
will be set right by the local antiquarian on names
and dates connected with some obscure town, but
in turn he will convey to his learned friend some
ideas on the relative importance of localities and
on the topography of the whole country. The
tourist will not be provincial or municipal or suburban.
He will not mistake his native hamlet for
the world or make it the sole standard of excellence.
The tourist will give you a map; the local
antiquarian will draw up a surveyor’s chart, with
the number of inches to the grade and the number
of feet to the surface. Should not the teacher of
literature consider it his duty to encourage the
tourist, to introduce the student into the world of
meaning, and not to keep him with theodolite and
the leveling-rod along the borders of expression,
counting words, measuring phrases, or drawing up
lifeless charts of tabulated facts? When the student
has come home from his travels, he may, if
he chooses, lay aside his guide book, and, having
seen the world, confine his energies to mastering a
portion of it. If, however, he should have brought
home from his wanderings nothing more than a
love of literature and all that means, will his
teacher’s life have been in vain? John Goulding of
Cork might be considered not entirely useless, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
he gave us no more than Justin McCarthy, who thus
describes the results of his master’s work:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not venture to say that Mr. Goulding’s method of
teaching was directly adapted to create a thoroughly scholastic
knowledge of Greek and Latin, and I do not know whether his
pupils would have been likely by means of his instruction alone
to take honors in any university competition, but I know that it
made all of us, who had a taste for such, ready and fluent
readers in Greek and Latin and as familiar with most of the
Greek and Latin poets as with Shakespeare and Keats. It was
in truth literary rather than scholastic instruction.”</p>

<span class="smaller">EDUCATING THE EMOTIONS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Life is full to the brim with emotions. Not
war only nor political rallies nor the excited
throngs at sports are vibrant with emotion, but there
is not a single act of life which has not some emotion,
quiet or intense, as its source, its companion
and its effect. Man ought to be ruled by cold reason,
but he responds to feelings and succumbs to
feelings.</p>

<p>Today more than ever in the history of the world
is emotionalism rampant. Civilization has made
mankind a crowd. We touch elbows with the world.
The Egyptian hermit has now “the privacy of a
goldfish in a glass bowl.” An individual by himself
may indeed deliberate and philosophize, but
a crowd feels and acts. As soon as it stops cheering,
it begins to disintegrate into thinking individuals,
who creep silently back to the hermitage
of home. The war, with its drives of all kinds, the
elections, the athletic contests, have made us
familiar with the nature of a crowd. The mob is a
high-pressure crowd, and the feelings which burn
in the crowd explode violently in a mob. Civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
has brought mankind into the closeness of a
crowd, but not yet to the explosive confusion of a
mob.</p>

<p>War taught us too the great value of morale.
What is morale? What is that light in the sky, that
solid ground under foot, that winged buoyancy of
the heart? Morale might be described as organized
emotion. A crowd is fickle because it feels instead
of reasons. Morale is the counter-force to fickleness.
Emotions are awakened, are focused on a
given point, are stabilized, and the result is morale.
Courage hardens to pluck, duty flames into devotion
and bravery is transfigured into heroism.</p>

<p>Life therefore is flooded with emotion, all the
way from every action of the individual up to the
responsive crowd, yielding to panic, exploding into
violence or steadied by morale. What then is education
doing for the emotions? Whether education
be considered a development of the individual
capacities, or an adjustment of man to the community,
education should not neglect the emotions.
The controlling tendencies, however, of the modern
school would seem to ignore or belittle emotions.
Modern schools pride themselves on being practical
and scientific. They have become more immersed
in matter than in man. They are materialistic
in the wide sense, or naturalistic, but they are
less and less humanistic. Three great fields lie before
the spirit of man, the field of truth, the field
of beauty and the field of good. No traveler can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
reach beauty and good except through truth, but
education seems to think its work is done if it travels
the regions of truth and ignores the regions of
beauty and good.</p>

<p>All education formerly could be divided into two
stages, the earlier of preparation, the later of application.
The individual was taught to speak and
write and was equipped with the general information
necessary to all. He who was able to speak and
write was able to express himself, and self-expression,
which argued that man’s powers were working
normally, was the satisfactory goal in the first stage
of education. After the development of the individual
came his application to the study of his life-work
in professional schools and universities.</p>

<p>In the former of these two stages, as self-expression
was the end, language was the chief and almost
exclusive means. Sciences were relegated to the university
and informational subjects were left strictly
subordinated, and the whole course was predominately
humanistic. Modern education has profoundly
changed this simple arrangement. The
university method of education and electivism and
specialization have been advanced to college, to
high school and to grade school. Many natural
sciences have been systematized and brought into
early classes. The university chemistry and
physics of fifty years ago are now in the grades. Besides
professional courses, pre-medical, pre-law,
pre-divinity, pre-engineering, pre-journalism, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
in general pre-professional studies are in our schools
or at the doors. The trades are not behind the
professions. The million trades which concern
themselves with the production of raw material or
with the manufacture of raw material into finished
products or with the distribution of finished products,
all these are knocking at the door or looking
in the window of our school. Nor is that all. As
the professions want pre-professional and the trades
pre-trade courses, so the state demands pre-citizen
courses in civic and hygienics and military tactics,
and the home exacts pre-family courses in eugenics
and many domestic sciences. Do not close your curriculum
list yet. The profession, the trade, the
home, the state are not all, and to leave out religion,
which calls for pre-religious courses in private
schools, we have the whole field of sport and
play in pre-dancing, pre-ball-playing, and at last pre-movies.
To make the conquest of the practical
complete, it is seriously advocated by a special committee
of the N. E. A. that this bewildering multiplicity
of sciences, professions, trades, civic, domestic
and amusement courses should be begun at the
junior high school or seventh grade.</p>

<p>There is the contrast. Life is emotional. The
early schools that used to be devoted chiefly to writing
and speaking, are now crowded with a multiplicity
of fact subjects, and even language and literature,
the most humanistic and emotional subjects
of our courses, are taught theoretically by university<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and scientific methods. In the Jesuit <i>Ratio Studiorum</i>,
which did not differ essentially from other
systems, four years of the lower schools were given
to correct expression of the truth, one year to the
element of interest, or beauty, in expression, and one
whole year to the element of force, or good, in expression.
These two latter classes were called humanities
and rhetoric and correspond to the present
freshman and sophomore classes in Jesuit
colleges.</p>

<p>The reason why a whole year was given to the
elements of interest and force in self-expression is
found in the twofold nature of emotions. One set
of emotions arises from the apprehension of good
or avoidance of evil. Another set arises from the
perception of the novel, humorous and beautiful.
These latter comprehend the emotions of surprise,
wonder, delight, awe, in general, the esthetic emotions.
The other emotions, called appetitive, include
love and hate, with desire and fear, joy and sadness,
pity and anger and many others.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the teacher the teaching of emotions
is somewhat simplified by the fact that both
kinds of emotions respond, not to abstract truth but
to truth in the concrete and concrete truth takes on
beauty or good and awakens emotions through the
imaginations of teacher and student. Teachers who
themselves imagine will awaken emotions and educate
emotions by exercising them. Teachers who
imagine will make pupils imagine by making them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
translate all truth from the abstract to the concrete.
The perpetual question on the lips of the
teacher, “For instance?” will embody truth in the
concrete, exercise students in imagination and make
truth emotional and abiding.</p>

<p>Interesting and enthusiastic teachers are always
training emotions. Emotion is not imparted by instruction;
it is kindled by contact. Teachers who
have their subjects transferred from dead books to
their warm, living imaginations, will be interesting,
will be moving. They will excite surprise and wonder
by novelty and beauty of presentation. They
will make their classes expand with love or shrink
in horror at the pictures of good or evil.</p>

<p>After imagination and actual feeling on the part
of both student and teacher, the next best means of
educating emotions is the stimulating of action, especially
in the way of original self-expression through
the written and spoken word. One of the happy
tendencies of our modern education is the restoring
of oral expression to its former high place.</p>

<p>These means just mentioned will be helpful in
any subject of the curriculum, but the principal instrument
in the schools for training the emotions
will be literature. Literature is the embodiment of
human emotions, in story, in essay, poem, and
speech. The schools must hold on to the teaching
of literature. They must make a stand against the
imperialism of facts and so-called practical subjects.
The schools must never forget that it is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
least just as practical to have a heart in life as to
have a head. A modern French scholar has said:
“Humanities and letters are man himself, to remove
them from education, it would be necessary
to commence by taking man from man.”</p>

<p>Instruction in trades is a knack, not an education
of man. A savage can learn to run an automobile,
and there are many today running automobiles,
but a savage does not enjoy literature or produce
literature. Science has its center outside of man, it
is impersonal and unemotional. Literature is human,
is personal, it appeals to the heart which must
not be starved while the head is stuffed.</p>

<p>But even when the teachers of literature have
the works of man in their hands, they must not rob
them of all emotions by making their teaching of
them historical only, or analytical only or theoretical
only, lowering Macbeth to a footnote in Scottish
history or to an argument for the theory of the
romantic movement or to a dissertation on the psychology
of temptation. Literature must be taught
as literature, not as history, not as ethics. Literature
should be taught as an art, not as a science.
The teacher should keep self-expression in view.
The teacher will consider the work of literature as
the expression of a man. Before the class the
masterpiece of literature will grow and crystallize
into unity. The students will watch its creation;
they will reflect the light from the eyes of an enthusiastic
teacher; they will grasp the truth vividly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and emotionally; they will be thrilled with the
truth that has taken shape in their teacher’s imagination,
that has been dramatized before them in
suggestive detail, that will teach the students themselves
how to think, how to imagine, how to find
for the embodied truth a local habitation and a
name, how to express themselves in words which
fascinate and inflame.</p>

<p>So will the emotions by their exercise be developed
and by their expression be controlled. The
world of the classroom is a little world and its tiny
emotions are as dew-drops to a deluge, but for the
young hearts in school the world of the classroom
is a gigantic world and its slight emotions are adequate
to teach beginners. For a dew drop may be
a deluge for a violet and its very food and life.</p>

<span class="smaller">KEEP THE CLASSICS BUT TEACH THEM</span></h3>

</div>

<p>This is not the time to drop Latin or Greek
openly or under the subterfuge of optional
electives. Colleges everywhere are crowded. Buildings
are too small for the students; classes are too
large for the professors. Now is the time to impose
stricter conditions rather than to open wider
the doors to colleges, and now is the proper time
to restore the classical languages, and especially
Greek, if not to favor, because knowledge maketh
a bloody entrance, and its weapons are resented, at
least to respectable toleration, by teaching them in
the right way. Do not empty the baby with the
bath, but do draw off the stagnant waters and let
the bright showers sparkle and sing and refresh.
Don’t throw out Greek, but do teach Greek as
literature, as the art of self-expression, as a practical
and permanent possession of the student
through appreciation and through composition in
his own language.</p>

<p>Greek authors used to be put in the students’
hands with a Latin paraphrase. In Jesuit schools
the explanation of the author included a translation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
which might be dictated to the class. This was
done because in Latin, and especially in Greek,
which was not the language to be used in life, the
proper and real work began after the interpretation
was known. That proper work was artistic
appreciation and artistic reproduction in one’s own
language, formerly Latin and now various languages.
Rather than cast out Greek, furnish the
students with Loeb or Jebb or Murray or Lang,
shorten grammatical drill, and then center attention
on the appreciation and the reproduction of the
finest literary art of all ages, exacting compositions
written and spoken in the student’s own language.
This is not a revolutionary proposal, the system
now prevalent is revolutionary; but it is a proposal
to relegate to the university the specialism and scientific
handling of literature, and an earnest plea
to retain or restore to the classics, especially Greek,
their age-old method, proper to the general training
of academy and of college and profitable to
every student if the art of speaking and writing is of
lifelong utility.</p>

<p>The teaching of literature has a handicap which
is not found in the teaching of other arts. A
painter must know some practical facts about preparing
and applying paints, but he need not know
the whole chemistry of pigments or the physics of
colors. The sculptor must choose the right kind of
marble, but he does not take a course in geology.
In all arts except literature the contact with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
artist’s work is almost immediate. But in literature
a language must be mastered, and in mastering
that language a thousand sciences have obtruded
themselves between the student and the masterpiece.
Gustav Foch of Leipsic published some years ago a
catalog of dissertations printed in Germany during
the latter part of the nineteenth century. The catalog,
which was by no means complete, containing
only the items he was prepared to furnish, listed
27,000 titles. This formidable number concerned
itself entirely with the Greek and Roman writers
and embodied special studies on the history, the
evolution, the text, the erudition of classical literature.
Practically nothing of this immense flood of
special dissertations touched on the art of literature.</p>

<p>Now, if all this tremendous erudition were left
to the university, where it properly belongs, not
much harm would be done; but unhappily the study
of literature as a science has almost completely excluded
its study as an art. The small school of Dissen,
Rehdantz and Blass, who represented in Germany
the artistic appreciation of Greek literature,
was submerged by the immensely greater number
of scientific investigators. The classical poets, with
the exception of Homer, fared better than the
prose authors; but all literature, instead of being a
help to the art of composition, was subordinated
to establishing a theory or to exemplifying a
generalization.</p>

<p>France resisted almost entirely this scientific obsession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
of literature. England held out long. In
both of these nations composition in the classical
languages was a fixed feature of the schools. Victorian
literature is steeped in the classics, especially
of Greece; the golden age of England’s eloquence,
the age of Chatham, Fox and Burke, preceded the
scientific era of classicism and was the product of
artistic appreciation and of composition.</p>

<p>What of America? The earlier schools followed
French and English traditions and taught
the classics with literary appreciation and with
fruitful results for the literature of America. Then
later America sent its professors to Germany;
specialism and the departmental system separated
literature entirely from the classics; composition
ceased except as a means of learning grammar, thus
establishing a complete reversal of the original practice,
where grammar was a means to composition.</p>

<p>It would be untrue to say that all the erudition,
discovered and systematized by numerous sciences
and centering upon the classics, was useless or unprofitable.
Even the immense library which the
Wolfian theory of Homeric origins brought into
existence has not been entirely in vain. Germany of
the nineteenth century was the Alexandria of the
modern world, and as Alexandrian criticism was the
forerunner of the best in Latin literature, perhaps
the immense activity of scientific investigators may
have an artistic outcome. A selection of what is
good and true, and a clear, concise presentation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
well-established facts, such as Père Laurand gives
in his excellent series, <i>Manuels des Etudes Grecques
et Latines</i> (Picard, Paris), will help the study of
the classics. Erudition should take now its proper
place of subordination. The classics should resume
the functions which history, evolution, origins and
other scientific approaches have taken away; the
classics should once more be studied primarily as
works of art. The medium and materials do not
dominate other arts; they should not dominate literature.
Self-expression is the goal of all art; it
should be the goal of literature.</p>

<p>Have the teachers of the classics lost faith? Is
artistic appreciation an idle thing or is it a thing of
beauty, a joy forever? The experimental sciences
are always changing in facts and theories. The
chemistry of a century ago is absurd; the chemistry
of twenty-five years ago is antiquated; the chemistry
of today will be old tomorrow. As Remsen long
ago saw and insisted on, what is valuable in the
teaching of chemistry are the processes, not the
theories, which will likely change tomorrow.
Chemistry, as a science, is a bit of classified information
always modified by research. Art and artistic
appreciation is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
Give a man appreciation of literature; let him taste
the beauty of Homer and of Sophocles and of
Demosthenes, and you have given him, not a catalog
of facts which must always be rectified, not a
theory which must change with the facts, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
precious treasure in the mind which will always remain.
In teaching chemistry the processes are more
important than the temporary information; in the
teaching of literature the processes are at least
equally valuable, and besides last through life in
abiding taste and in perfected self-expression.</p>

<p>Formerly reproduction was the aim of the
teacher of the classics. “Reproduction is the soul
of the explanation or prelection,” is the way early
Jesuit pedagogy put it, and every student of philosophy
knows what the soul or formal cause contributes
to the effect. How many in explaining classical
literature today guide themselves throughout
by the principle that their students are to reproduce
artistically the masterpiece which they explain?
No doubt professors insist upon the formation
of clear ideas and further demand explicit judgments
in the way of propositions. Most too require
that the links of reasoning be sharply and definitely
stated. Interpretation, in a word, is well done.
The intellectual element of the masterpiece is
handled satisfactorily. But what of the artistic
form? Does the literature take shape in the student’s
imagination? Is the picture realized in the
teacher’s imagination and then by suggestion,
through the sparkling eye and sympathetic voice and
interpreting gesture, by vivid, though not histrionic,
dramatization, is the author’s message staged in
the student’s imagination? Scientific analysis, especially
where a text becomes a tag to some learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
generalization, often prevents imaginative realization
and thus precludes artistic appreciation of
literature.</p>

<p>The teaching of the classics has been and is now
justified by the general training they impart, but it
is chiefly when taught as literature that they impart
that general training. If the classics are subordinated
to the university lecturer’s specialty, then the
classics are imparting little general training and
have hardly more right in the classroom, except for
indirect results which may accrue from contact with
art, than have special courses in conchology or entomology.
Let the teacher look upon the classics
as art to be reproduced after being appreciated,
and a general training will be the outcome. Composition
should be made the aim of literature.</p>

<p>Idioms of languages, and their vocabulary and
their structure differ, but thought and imagination
may be the same. Set all the languages of the world
before a moving-picture, and each language will
tell the common story on the screen to its children in
its own way of speaking. So the student of any
language may learn from Homer how to select
details and group them into artistic wholes, how to
carry on the narrative through significant and
choice events, how to dwell on the important and
touch lightly on the insignificant, how to relieve a
story and intensify a part of it by appropriate comparisons.
As the student learns how to tell a story,
so too may he master the art of describing a scene,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
of creating a character, of making a speech. He
will be taught the way to focus an idea and give it
discriminating expression by the right word, the
way to embody good or evil in concrete and picturesque
words and the way to be proficient in all the
elements and processes of composition. The Greek
Homer made the Latin Æneid, the Greek Theocritus
made the Latin Eclogue and, if Stedman is right,
also the Tennysonian Idyll. The literary art of
Greek and Latin has given and will give artistic
form to the student’s vernacular.</p>

<p>The classics will give a general training if they
are made to do so. Literature will not impart a
general training automatically. Art is a habit arising
from a repetition of acts. The art of thinking is
mastered by thinking, and the art of imagining by
imagining, and that thinking and imagining will be
done well if done under the guidance of masters.
Has the literary art of Greece, which created Latin
literature and directly and indirectly shaped the
literature of all civilization, done its full work?
Who can believe it? Every generation since Homer
has been influenced by the art of Homer in translation
and imitation, and no generations more so than
those of Cowper and Morris and Lang in England
and of Bryant and Palmer in America. The time
may come when literary taste and literary art will be
as well studied and demonstrated in modern languages
as in those of Latin and Greek; the time may
come when modern classics may be as well adapted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
for education as the classics of Greek and Rome
which have been in the classroom for century upon
century, but that time does not appear to be tomorrow
or the day after. If the art of self-expression
is the best test of education, if the art of self-expression
is the most practical thing in life and the
most permanent treasure that can be gained in
school, then Greek literature, the finest masterpiece
of self-expression, should remain, and Greek literature
should be taught, as for centuries it was taught,
with interpretation and translation furnished to the
student, leaving the time of training to be devoted
not to special sciences proper to the university, but
to the general training in appreciation and expression,
proper to academy and college.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VITALIZER OF THE WORLD</span></h3>

</div>

<p>This title is not an advertisement for a patent
medicine; it is the brief statement of an important
historical fact. “Every schoolboy knows”
that the revival of learning in Italy came from the
vitalizing touch of Greek. Out of that renaissance,
which the Jesuits took over and embodied in their
system of teaching, grew modern scholarship in
England through Linacre, Lilly, Colet and More,
the forerunners of the Elizabethans. It was the
beginning of modern scholarship in Germany,
through Erasmus, the friend of these Englishmen,
and through Melanchthon, whose name, like that
of Erasmus, marks the power of Greek: out of that
renaissance sprang the rejuvenated civilization of
our day. Every schoolboy knows that Greek
brought the modern world to life, but is it as well
known or remembered that Greek has always been
vivifying everything it touched?</p>

<p>The civilization of Rome in every part felt the
influence of Greece. Rome conquered the world by
force of arms, but itself was humanized and then
humanized the world through Greece. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
modern language today feels the force of Isocrates
and Demosthenes through Cicero, and of Alcæus
and Sappho through Horace, and of Greek tragedy
through Seneca and of Homer through Virgil.
When later the barbarians of the north severed
Rome from Greece and the Roman Empire and
its civilization lay dead, who brought the world to
life again? “When the accurate knowledge of
Latin was declining in Gaul, even Greek was not
unknown in Ireland.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was the Irish monks who
freshened into flame the blackening embers of
European civilization and began its restoration.
The revival was brought about through the schools
of Bobbio and St. Gall, mostly indeed as the scattered
books of their libraries show, by means of Latin
literature but always with the help of Greek, as the
same libraries testify. That was an earlier renaissance
in Italy and Switzerland. And who was the
leading figure in the revival in Spain about the
same time? It was the Greek scholars, Isidore of
Seville and, a little earlier, Hosius of Cordova, and,
a little later, John of Gerona. Then France began
to grope out of barbarism under the leadership of
Charlemagne, resuming close relations with Greece
and importing the Irish monks, Clement and Dungal,
and the English monk, Alcuin. But it was under
Charlemagne’s successor, Charles the Bald, that
this new renaissance took on a fresh energy which
did not spend itself before the decline of scholasticism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
John Scotus, John the Irishman, who styled
himself in his translation of Dionysius from the
Greek by the title of Erin-born, for a quarter of
a century kept France intellectually alive, and did
it chiefly by his Greek. John, the Erin-born, was the
forerunner of scholastic philosophy, which caught
the vital force of Greek through another channel
also. When Spain was conquered by barbarians
and lost its civilization, where did its Arabian conquerors
go for the seeds of the new life? The
Arabs went to Greece, gave Aristotle in translation
to Europe, and ushered in the golden age of
medieval philosophy. Rightly does Traini (1345),
on an altar-piece in Pisa, picture St. Thomas
Aquinas receiving the light of knowledge from
Christ through the Greek New Testament and
from Aristotle on his right and from Plato on his
left. As Aquinas combined patristic and scholastic
theology, he merged in his works the twofold Greek
influences of Plato and Aristotle, who were the human
aids in each of these theologies.</p>

<p>Pass over several centuries to the time when the
Italian renaissance had grown senile and when
scholarship left Spain, Italy and, to a large extent,
France, and found its home in the north. These
nations lost touch with Greek and their scholarship
died down, while life moved northward in the wake
of Greek. When F. A. Wolf went to Halle about
the beginning of the nineteenth century, he represented
the reaction against the realism of that day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and “his conflict with the school of useful knowledge
brought into clear relief his ideal of a culture
founded on Greek traditions.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Time has shown
that Wolf’s theories of Homeric authorship are all
wrong, but the stimulus he gave to scholarship
lasted all through the nineteenth century, and to
no other single influence more than to Wolf may
Germany ascribe its undoubted supremacy in classical
learning during the last century. His inspiration
came from the Greek, and in his vitalizing of
Germany he was associated with others who had
felt the same inspiration and were already beginning
the influence that still in a measure persists:
Heyne in the classics, Lessing in criticism and
Winckelmann in art.</p>

<p>England’s partial reawakening under Queen
Anne saw Bentley, the Greek scholar, and his contemporary,
Pope, translator of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>,
and let scholars say what they will about Pope’s
translation, they cannot impugn the fine criticism of
his introductions or the lasting influence for good of
his versions. Passing over the prime of English
eloquence, whose living roots, as Goodrich has
shown, are in Greek literature, we come to the
fresh memories of our own time and to the Victorian
era. Again it is Greek which vitalizes every branch
of literature, philosophy and art with new and unexpected
truth and life. Without Greek the Victorian
revival would not have come about. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
poetry recall Keats, who awoke to life through the
reflected glory of Homer; recall Cowper, translator
of Homer, and Byron, who died for Greece, and
Moore, who translated Anacreon, and Landor and
Arnold and Tennyson and Browning, all of whom
took substance and form and fire from Greek
sources. In essay-writing you have Brougham, eloquent
advocate of Greek oratory; De Quincey, who
could, as his tutor said, at the age of thirteen
harangue a Greek crowd; Macaulay, who, even in
manhood, weeps over his Homer on the streets of
London. In art there are Ruskin and Morris and
Pater, who are saturated with Greek thought.
Think of statesmanship and you will recall Lord
Derby and Gladstone, political rivals, at one in their
love of Homer; think of criticism, and Lang, Saintsbury,
Blackie, Butcher and Jebb will say that
through Greek they have dominated modern criticism;
think of history, and the names of Rawlinson
and Grote and Hallam, Grecians, will come forward
in your mind. History! Why, you will remember
that all ancient history has recently been
rewritten with the spade, and it was Schliemann
under the spell of Homer who turned the first sod.</p>

<p>Go over the great names in literature and art, in
philosophy, theology and scripture, in the sciences
of history, mathematics, law, government, and you
will find Greek giving life and vigor. Even in the
newer sciences founded on observation and experience,
which have come into being within a century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
whenever an observer gets beyond the elementary
stage of research and classification, he will resort
to Greece for principles and intellectual categories
just as he borrows the language of Greece with
which to name his discoveries. History shows that
every people and every system of education and
every house of learning, when it gives up Greek, is
headed towards inferiority and decay, but when it
turns with fresh endeavor toward Greek it reaches
forth to life and to light. Nor is all this surprising
or strained. Our civilization was born and grew
for centuries in Greece. Our Christianity was early
translated into the language of Greece and for centuries
spoke and thought chiefly in that tongue. So
then in our minds and souls our youth will ever
have been Greek, and from Greek must ever come,
as it has come in the past, the new blood that will
flush with dynamic energy the anemic arteries of
cosmos, the world, and of the microcosm, man.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV<br />
<span class="smaller">TRUE PRINCIPLES OF HOMERIC CRITICISM</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The story of Phidias and his pupil, Alcamenes
has often been told. They competed for a
prize in sculpture. The statue of Alcamenes was
about to be chosen because of its exquisite finish
when Phidias objected to any decision until the
statues should be put in the high position they were
designed to occupy. At once, the opinions of the
judges were reversed, for the apparently rough
lines of Phidias’s creation stood out in sublime majesty,
while the polish of Alcamenes’s was lost when
the statues were raised aloft. The story illustrates
a splendid rule of art which has often been
forgotten in the study of Homer. The epics of
Homer were not made for the test-tube and the
microscope. They were not made even for readers;
they were composed for listeners. Put them on their
proper pedestals and the minutiæ revealed by the
grammarian’s microscope will be lost in the grand
sweep of the story. You would as soon halt Shakespeare’s
<i>Macbeth</i> because of the anachronisms, or
condemn Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper” because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of modern masonry in the walls or carpentry in the
table, as apply the philological and archeological
tests of the higher critics to Homer.</p>

<p>Apply the tests of art to Homer and judge him by
those. Take the matter of the contradictions which
critics have talked so much about. In many cases,
especially where mythology was concerned, the material
the poet had to handle bristled with inconsistencies
and contradictions. Long ago Aristotle laid
down the sensible rule for drama, and it is equally
true for epic poetry, that the poet is not responsible
for the improbabilities in his materials. The sculptor
may have flaws in his block of marble; the
painter may have defects in his lead or oil, or pigments;
and the epic poet found contradictions in
the fairy stories of mankind which he wove into the
story he sang. That one consideration will sweep
away instantly heaps of higher criticism.</p>

<p>Again, the artist is more taken up with the end
than he is with the means. In the fervor of his
composition he wreaks himself upon expression, he
burns to embody his ideal and, engrossed in that,
he is likely to be less observant of the material of
his art. The achieving of the effect is more to him
than mathematical accuracy in the use of the instruments
by which he achieves the effect. He makes
his hero win his battle; he may unhappily forget
some of the tactics or even the geography of the
battlefield. His object is not to teach the art of
warfare or furnish the topography of the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
but to tell an interesting story in an interesting way.
The <i>Iliad</i> has a wall that vexes many critics. It
was built in the tenth year of the war, which was no
time to build a wall, and was put up simply because
Achilles left the field. Besides, according to these
critics the wall appears and disappears strangely.
So the conclusion is: Homer did not build the wall,
but some other poet came along and projected his
masonry into the epic. In answer it has been shown
that the wall behaves very well, but, whether it does
or not, it matters little. The poet is not a surveyor
or a street commissioner. He wished to make his
story interesting, to make the character of Achilles
prominent, to bring some agreeable variety into
what might prove a monotonous catalog of similar
battles. Those are reasons enough for a poet to
build a Chinese wall or reduce it to dust when he
does not want it, or conveniently overlook it in the
heat of an imaginary charge.</p>

<p>A story-teller is more concerned to please his
hearers than to guard against inconsistencies which
they would never detect as listeners, and which even
close readers did not detect for about thirty centuries.
A work of art is not to be judged as a mass
of machinery is, nor is a poem to be scrutinized with
dictionary and grammar as you would a schoolboy’s
exercise. This is the statue of Phidias over again.
A stage scene will differ somewhat from a miniature,
and an epic takes liberties with walls and rivers and
even mountains and oceans, liberties which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
not be tolerated in a quatrain. These principles
are as obvious as daylight, but apostles of the obvious
are needed in abundance in the harvest fields
of higher criticism.</p>

<p>What is needed for Homer is a study of his art
in a broad but not shallow way, comprehensive and
fundamental like Aristotle’s brief discussion. For
the wonderfully analytical mind of Aristotle
Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were models of unity,
because he looked upon them as works of art, not
scrap-heaps of philology and archeology. Put the
poems of Homer on the pedestals for which he
made them, for listeners who had to be entertained
and clamored for variety. “It is a trait of Homer,”
says a writer, “constantly to shift the scene. The
motive may be weak, but the eye of the poet was not
on the motive, but on the scene; so he not only shifts
the scene but varies the description of the events.”
The poet’s eye, it might be added, is also like the
orator’s, fixed steadily on his audience, and the audience
must be relieved even if masonry or geography
suffer.</p>

<p>The paramount principles of variety and growth
of interest which govern every good story hold sway
in Homer. Take a staple action of the <i>Iliad</i>, the
battles. Homer’s audience wanted fighting, yet
jaded listeners and the artistic poet knew there must
be in the fighting variety and growth of interest.
Even in the matter of killing men, which seems to
us unimportant but which would not be to an audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
of fighters, Homer has shown a wonderful
variety. A German professor has diagnosed the
Homeric surgery with all the thoroughness of his
class. The conclusions may be found in Seymour’s
<i>Life in the Homeric Age</i>. The number and variety
of the wounds, the weapons used, the percentages
of fatalities, are all given in full detail. “Hardly
could the poet have covered more completely the
possibilities of wounds for the human body if he had
proceeded systematically and mechanically.” Some
will have it that Homer was a surgeon and an army
doctor. Certainly the history of anatomy has its
first chapter in the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<p>But to pass over the variety displayed in the
wounds and other smaller points, consider the actual
fighting. For the maneuvers we may refer to two
interesting chapters in Lang’s <i>World of Homer</i>,
where the variety and consistency of Homeric warfare
are well described and defended against the
dissectionists. The point, however, we are working
toward is the variety shown in even the external
circumstances of the warfare. A closer study
than we can afford to give would reveal more
variety, but we may mention the plain, the wall,
the river, the night as in the tenth book, the mist.
These are the various circumstances which the poet
introduces into his battles, relieving the monotony
and sustaining the interest. There is no falling off.
The different heroes, too, succeed one another; the
victory alternates from one side to the other; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
battle on earth has its echo among the gods. The
interest rises. Patroclos enters the fight, and then
his fallen body becomes the center of the struggle,
as the wall and the ships had been before. Something,
too, is left for Achilles. Ferocious as may
have been the fighting before, it becomes a veritable
shambles when Achilles enters the fray. Never
were such frightful wounds, never such rivers of
blood as may be witnessed in Book XX “when the
black earth ran blood,” “when beneath the great-hearted
Achilles his whole-hooved horses trampled
corpses and shields together; and with blood all the
axle-tree below was sprinkled and the rims that ran
around the car, for blood-drops from the horses’
hooves splashed them and blood-drops from the
tires of the wheels. But the son of Peleus pressed on
to win his glory, flecking with gore his irresistible
hands.”</p>

<p>Then follows the battle in the river, and finally
the battle of the gods themselves, and after the
necessary relief and lull and reawakening of interest
comes the last battle of all and the climax of the
poem in the conflict of Achilles and Hector.</p>

<p>A study of the art of Homer along its great lines
will give us the true principles upon which to judge
him. Such a study will put him in the right perspective.
The statue of Phidias will mount on high
where its artist wished to have it enshrined. The
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were meant to cross the bronze
threshold of some great palace, “where there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
gleam as it were of sun or moon through the high
roofed hall of a great-hearted King. Brazen were
the walls which ran this way and that from the
threshold to the inmost chamber, and round then
was a frieze of blue and within were seats arrayed
against the wall this way and that.” Then “after the
men had put from them the desire of meat and
drink,” they called upon the minstrel. “For minstrels
from all men on earth get their meed of honor
and worship; inasmuch as the muse teacheth them
the paths of song and loveth the tribe of minstrels.”
“And the minstrel being stirred by the god began
and showed forth his minstrelsy and took up the
tale where it tells how the Argives sailed away.”
That was the setting of the Homeric Epic, and thus
speaks one whose “heart had melted at the song and
whose tears wet his cheeks beneath his eyelids.”
“Verily it is a good thing to list to a minstrel, like
to the gods in voice. Nay, as for me, I say there is
no more gracious or perfect delight than when a
whole people makes merry, and the men sit orderly
at feasts in the halls and listen to the singer and the
tables by them are laden with bread and flesh, and
pours it into cups. This fashion seems to me the
fairest thing in the world.”</p>

<p>There is the place that Homer chose for his
matchless poems, and there they should be judged.
The hearts that melt with song are not searching
for digammas or Æolic forms. They want the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
story, the long voyages and the strange adventures,
the swaying lines of battle and the prowess of
heroes. They look for and recognize the different
characters which must be as varied and as clearly
marked as in the life around them. They must not
be surfeited with too much of anything. Voyages
and battles must vary and grow in intensity and be
crossed with pictures of nature, brief but thrilling
and immensely relieving,—the lion, the wheat field,
the tossing ocean and the steady downfall of an
unending snow storm. With these and the plot entangling
and disentangling, the listeners to Homeric
song and story will not look for that polished
smoothness and frigid exactness, the absence of
which vexes the minds of modern Germany. Phidias’
statue occupies its proper pedestal, and the true
judges award to Phidias his well-deserved prize.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHILD-TEST OF LITERATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Their elders are too busy these days devising
tests for the children. Is it not time for the
children to retort on their testers? “Having pried
and prodded into us to see if we measure up to you,
dear elders, let us now see,” the children may well
say, “whether you measure up to us.” A great
philosopher wished to make man the measure of
everything. We have a truer, a divine philosophy,
a philosophy all the more persuasive, and that philosophy
makes the child the measure and test of
man’s worth and the arbiter of his eternal destiny.
“Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God,
as a child, shall not enter it.” The millstone mooring
the scandalizer in the ooze of ocean’s darkest
depths and the angels who see the face of their little
one’s Father, these are the extreme sanctions which
guarantee the accuracy of the child-test for the
measurement of man.</p>

<p>The child-test has often been applied to man’s
morals. Onan and Sanger, Sparta and China, Calvin’s
unchristian infant damnation and the Christless
infant sanctification of Pelagius, Malthus with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
“Decrease and subtract” and Moses with his “Increase
and multiply,” all, from individuals to nations,
are ample evidence that the child is set for the ruin
and resurrection of many in Israel. The child-test
is surely potent in rating the world’s moral morons
and moral geniuses.</p>

<p>Can the child-test be applied to man’s art and literature?
Recall the words of Job, “Who shut up
the sea with doors, when I made a cloud the garment
thereof and wrapt it in a mist in swaddling bands?”
That view of the sea in the swaddling bands of infancy
is a proof of an imagination looking at the
universe with the eyes of the Creator. The child-test
is a measure of the sublimity of Hebrew literature.
The revelation of Genesis gave the literature
of the Bible an outlook never reached by other
literatures. As the promise of the Messiah kept a
hallowing guard over the cradles of Israel, so the
vision of the Creator blotted out from the concepts
of the Hebrew imagination the crude and monstrous
nativities which make all pagan mythologies hybrid
and miscegenetic.</p>

<p>Homer has fewer than others have of these nightmares,
but it is not in them nor in the tinsel sublimity
of his divine machinery that Homer has touched a
wider circle of readers than any of his epic brethren.
Rather it is in his unaffected and transparent portrayal
of the human nature we all understand that
Homer has set the heart of the world throbbing
faster. Not the celibate Virgil, nor the Puritanic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Milton, dissolver of matrimony, nor yet Dante,
idealizer of the maiden Beatrice, gave us childhood
and motherhood as Homer has done. Homer is no
sentimentalist, but he has wider sympathies with
mother and child than any author on the rolls of
literature. The mother cow, lowing over its first-born;
the mother dog, growling in defense of its
litter; the mother lion, all its brow wrinkled with
the greatest frown ever sketched; the mother bird,
starving and dying for its young, yes, even the
mother wasp, solicitous for its menaced brood (note
that, S. P. C. A.!) these are evidences of Homer’s
tenderness. Achilles likens his friend Patroclus to a
little maid fondly catching at her mother’s dress and
getting in her way with persistent tearful pleading
till the mother takes her up. In the <i>Iliad</i>, Helen’s
sorrow for her abandoned Hermione is a pleasing
element in her repentance. Odysseus proudly styles
himself the father of Telemachus; the mother of
Odysseus dies for longing of him, and his father,
Laertes, in the most exquisite of the many recognition
scenes of the <i>Odyssey</i>, passes from view in that
story, while his long-absent son tells him of the fruit
trees, “which,” says Odysseus, “thou once gavest
me for mine own, and I was begging of thee this and
that, being but a child and following thee through
the garden.” We have natural sketches of the babyhood
of his two heroes, Achilles and Odysseus.</p>

<p>Yet, more than all these pictures, stands out in
the world’s imagination Hector’s boy, whose future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
fate Andromache, after Hector’s death, details with
a mother’s despairing vividness, whose childish terror
at his father’s helmet, while Andromache smiles
through her tears, has brought home to unnumbered
thousands the grim specter of war. That scene has
etched itself so deeply into the heart of mankind that
it has almost ruined Homer’s poem, alienating universal
sympathy from Achilles to Hector.</p>

<p>After Homer, the child <i>motif</i> in literature is less
in evidence. Drama, of its nature, has little place
for the child except to put a keener poignancy in
tragedy. So Sophocles used the children of Œdipus.
So in his time did Shakespeare with the princes of
<i>Richard III</i>, with Marcellus in <i>Coriolanus</i>, with
Macduff’s sprightly lad, and with others. Theocritus
has a child to furnish an aside for the gossipy
Syracusan dames. Anacreon introduces the counterfeit
of childhood in the Cupids, whose sophisticated
conventionality checked invention in Elizabethan
lyrics as it did in art from Pompeii to Rubens and
later. Cupids are symbols, children of the brain,
not of the heart, and figure in song and painting as
signs. They have a message for the mind; they do
not touch the feelings, while on the other hand, they
free the artist from seeking in life the expressive
significance that Homer gave the child.</p>

<p>Literature had to wait long for the naturalness of
Homer to reappear. Virgil has a little of it in
Ascanius, another Cupid, and it is significant that
Virgil’s one outstanding natural touch is found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the famous Messianic eclogue: <i>Incipe, parve puer,
risu cognoscere matrem.</i> As for other Latins,
whether it be bachelorship or the erotic preoccupation
of the lyricists, or the supreme power of the
father in Roman customs and law, Latin literature
does not mirror for us prominently the child and
mother nor reflect their natural attractiveness as
found in Homer. Well, even Greece seems to have
lost the art, and a new inspiration was needed. That
inspiration came with the Divine Child of Bethlehem.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHRIST-CHILD TEST OF LITERATURE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The influence of the Christ-Child on painting
was tremendous and lasting. A history of
Christian art could be written around the Madonna,
and the subject has attracted the notice of many
writers, indexed in art libraries. Alice Meynell has
treated the subject attractively and with her studious
insight in the <i>Children of the Old Masters</i>. In the
Catacombs, Christian art felt and portrayed the
Divine Child and His Mother. Byzantine ornamentation
and mosaics gave the Child a rigid majesty
which veiled His winsomeness, but the master painters
came closer to childhood and brought Madonnas
from the walls of crypts and of cathedrals to the
devotional shrine and the chapel, making the Child
less architectural and more natural.</p>

<p>In literature the Christ-Child had equal influence
until Puritanism tried to remove Christmas from the
calendar. Drama originated in the liturgy of Easter
and of Christmas, and although Holy Week was
more elaborate and in substance more dramatic,
Christmas to Twelfth Night, offering more incentive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to play and song and more holidays, exercised a
larger influence on the stage. In lyric poetry at the
beginning of the sixth century we have already the
familiar, intimate and loving contact with the Christ-Child,
which finds its latest expression in Thompson
and Tabb. St. Ita, the Irish saint (480-570), is of
their faith and tenderness in the song of “Isucan,”
“Little Jesus,” given in Sigerson’s <i>Bards of the Gael
and Gall</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Jesukin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lives my little cell within</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The bambino shines through medieval song in Adam
of St. Victor and in other writers of hymns. The
Catholic writers of the Renaissance celebrate the
same theme in the revived meters of classicism.
Sarbievius, the Jesuit lyricist of Poland, is full of the
Christ-Child, and in his well-known lines “To the
Violet” he calls upon that “dawn of spring” to
crown his “Little Lad” with its flowers in place of
the gold and gems and purple which weighted the
Infant. Sarbievius was doing what the painters did,
discarding the Byzantine ornament and convention.</p>

<p>Test Puritanism with the child and it fails; test it
with the Christ-Child, and you will get the ponderous
“Hymn to the Nativity” of Milton, an imperialistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
ode which must have gladdened Cromwell. No
familiarity there, no mirthfulness, no Jesukin with
violets for crown jewels, not even Byzantine immobility.

war, as Hector did; no, he sees</p>

<p>A Prince of Peace indeed with a mailed fist!
Merry medieval England would not recognize
Jesukin in Miltonic panoply. Fortunately for art it
had attained excellence before the Puritanic blight
fell upon the world, but for literature in the English
language we must wait until the nineteenth century
to see the child come to its own. Wordsworth
attempted a revival of Plato’s philosophy and found
immortality, if not familiarity, in childhood when
he wrote his “Ode on the Intimations of Immortality.”
Wordsworth took a more fruitful lesson
from the Greeks when he went back to nature in
other poems to study childhood. Even before him,
Blake, painter and poet, influenced no doubt by the
traditions of painting, began to see the heart in
childhood. The interminable moralizing stories of
Ann and Jane Taylor and of Elizabeth Turner,
which date from this time, are heavy with grown up
condescension. E. V. Lucas would have done better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to republish in his <i>Book of Verses for Children</i> the
graceful and humorous lessons of the Greek fables
than perpetuate Taylor and Turner.</p>

<p>After Wordsworth we see the child <i>motif</i> gradually
taking a larger place in the literature of England
and America. Despite Francis Thompson’s
vigorous effort in his famous essay, he has not succeeded
in making Shelley pass the child-test. Shelley
had no faith, no humility, no humor, no real tenderness,
and even granting him the dreaming power of
childhood, which in Thompson’s essay is largely
a reflection of Thompson, Shelley had not the heard
of a child to enter into the Kingdom. Walter
Scott’s friendship for Marjorie Fleming shows that
the great poet and novelist had the necessary qualifications,
but no performance comes now to mind
except a lullaby and the glorification of merry England
at Christmas. Swinburne glimpses gleams of a
baby’s pink toes and lists to low laughter of mouths
of gold. The child is picturesque for him. Moore,
Byron, Browning, for different reasons, fail in the
child-test. Tennyson touched the surface, although
in the “Princess” he came close to the mystery.
Patmore, uxorious and paternal, came closer and
even touched the depths of the child in “Toys.”
Longfellow and Whittier were of the same school.</p>

<p>It was Stevenson, in a <i>Child’s Garden of Verses</i>
who brought back into poetry, as Lewis Carroll did
in prose and verse, the natural child that Homer
saw about him, and that painting discerned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the Babe of Bethlehem. Humor, imagination, sympathy,
these were the factors which discovered the
heart of childhood for our modern world. Barry
and Belloc in England, Eugene Field and Riley in
America, Earls and “Tom” Daly and many others
have furthered the discoveries. There is no hope
for the child in the “New Poetry” which takes itself
too seriously. Who would hold up the world if the
“new poets” started in to mind the baby?</p>

<p>One more element was needed, and sorely needed,
to enter fully into the mystery of the child. That
element is faith. Evolution looked on the child as
an epitome of its theory; pedagogy plotted out,
weighed and measured the child and drew up formidable
statistics; eugenics faced the child as though it
were a dire microbe, source of poverty, ignorance,
bootlegging, war, pestilence and famines. The modern
child had and still has before it a dismal prospect.
It is the camping ground of the specialist, the
experimental laboratory of the theorist, and the
peculiarly delectable victim of physical and moral
vivisectionists. Faith must save the child, faith in
the Babe of Bethlehem. Tabb and Thompson had
that faith. They are the counterpart in literature of
a St. Anthony or a St. Stanislaus in life and art.
They play with the Child Jesus. Isucan has come
into His own again. Tabb sings in “Out of
Bounds”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O comrades, let us one and all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Join in to get Him back his ball!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>And Francis Thompson with medieval intimacy
asks in “Ex Ore Infantium”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And did Thy Mother at the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kiss Thee, and fold the clothes in right?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And didst Thou feel quite good in bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kissed, and sweet, and Thy prayers said?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven,” said
Thompson. He will surely be at home there, and
Tabb and many another will be with him.</p>

</div>

<p>During a period of lethargy I was petrified at a phantom,
bounding from my lexicon, with this cataract of phrases:
“Are you Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Catholic,
or Christian? Without me, you are anonymous. Do you
stigmatize heresy and schism, hypocrisy and blasphemy. Do you
blame schemers against the Mosaic decalog? Do you impose
anathemas in apostates, idolaters and atheists or exorcise the
devil and his demons with their diabolical pomps? Are you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
zealous for proselytes, and to baptize neophytes after catechism,
and to canonize orthodox martyrs with halos and emblems,
scandalizing frenzied iconoclasts? Then all that is done
through me.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical sphere is practically mine. I am the architect
of churches, cathedrals and basilicas, from the asphalt base
in the crypts of the catacomb, up to the apse and the chimes in
the dome. I am architect of monasteries for monks and
anchorites, and of asylums for orphans and lepers and maniacs.
Mine is the Hierarchy, from the Pope on his dais with his tiara,
to the mitered Bishop in his diocese, and to the parish priest in
his presbytery. Deacons and acolytes, clergy and laity, Papal
encyclicals, diocesan synods, parochial homilies, and all dogmatic
theology, with its mysteries and myriad topics, are mine. The
Bible is mine from Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy of the Pentateuch,
to the Paralipomenon and the Psalms, to patriarchs and prophets,
to the Evangelists of Christ, to the Epistles and Apocalypse
of His Apostles. Epiphany, Pentecost, the Parasceve are mine
The tunes of the hymns, the quiring of anthems, the Gregorian
tones of the litanies and antiphons are melodious through
me and I composed the canon of liturgy with its symbols.</p>

<p>Go to your home with me. Bushels of anthracite for the
chimney, and a diet of fancied nectar! Chairs and plates and
dishes; oysters; butter and treacle; perch or trout or sardines
in olive oil; the aroma of capon or partridge or pheasant; celery
and asparagus and peppers; cherries and dates and currants,
citrons and melons, prunes and quinces and plums; pumpkins
marmalade and pastry; chestnuts and pippins; masses of purple
hyacinths, with lily and crocus, with geraniums and heliotropes,
with narcissus and peony, with asters and orchids and posies of
roses. What zest! Isn’t that a panorama of paradise to
tantalize you? Be not economical or dyspeptic. Masticate
beneath your mustache. Let choruses echo in the parlor with
music of organ and guitar, or let there be anecdotes on the
piazza around a bottle of cheering tonic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p>I telephone or telegraph for my “auto,” and my machine goes
to my theater or hippodrome. There is on my program the
symphony orchestra with harmonious melodies; or on my
program are scenes melancholy with tragedy, or hilarious with
pantomime and melodrama, with comic monolog or dramatic
dialog, with cyclists, gymnasts and acrobats. After the drama
or kinematic photography, with match and lamp you go to attic
canopies, and to the climes of Morpheus. For all these you are
to reimburse me with the treasuries of the purse.</p>

<p>Go with me to the ocean, opposing the stratagems and tactics
of barbarous pirates, to meander by gulf and isthmus and
archipelago, nomads through all climates, charting geography
with my nautical atlases, from the Arctic to the Antarctic
through the tropic zone, from Polynesia to its antipodes. Then
for my astronomy! What a panorama through my telescope in
the crystal atmosphere! Above the horizon in the empyrean are
my planets and comets and meteors and galaxies of asteroids.</p>

<p>Without me where is your “zoo” with its panthers and
leopards with dolphin and crocodile and hippopotamus, with
lynxes and hyenas, with ostrich and pelican, with buffalo and
dromedary, with ichneumons and scorpions, with the gigantic
elephant and its proboscis and the pygmy squirrel! Oh, what of
my chimerical and utopian “zoo,” with the phenix and dragon
and griffins and chameleons and gorgons and gnomes and
basilisks and sphinxes and hybrids!</p>

<p>But I am not archaic; the scope of my dynamic energy is
practical and not eccentric. Mine are politics, the diadems of
monarchs, the scepters of tyrants, barbarous anarchy and
despotic autocracy, the panics of demagogue and the parliaments
of autonomy and democracy. Chemistry and chemical analysis,
physics with phenomena of electricity, acoustics, and optics,
mechanics, botany, geology, entomology, and all the “ologies”
with their technical glossaries; they are mine.</p>

<p>So are all the apothecaries and pharmacies with glycerine and
licorice and creosote and the antidotes for quinsy; for catarrh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
dropsy, neuralgia, and for every “-itis” and “-osis”; emetics for
the stomach; the cathartics, calomel and castor-oil; doses of
paregoric for colic; plasters for imposthumes; arsenic for
spasms of epilepsy, and tonics for anemic arteries; a peptonoic
diet for dysentery; oxygen against bronchial phlegm; bromides
for asthma; iodine for pleurisy and parasites; narcotics to calm
hysteria; antipyrin for agonizing rheumatism; antitoxins for
diphtheria and for the deleterious microbes of cholera or
typhoid, and bottles of panaceas.</p>

<p>Anatomy is mine and the surgeon, diagnosing symptoms,
charting septic organs on the diagrams, trepanning the cranium,
cauterizing for hemorrhage, is mine; so are his sponges and
syringes and silk and his styptics, and his prophylactic hygiene,
and his anæsthetics, chloroform and ether, and his antiseptics
against bacteria and gangrene, and his autopsy and his skeletons.</p>

<p>The school is mine with its desks, its programs and schedule
and the scholars, from their alphabet to their diploma, their
arithmetic and geometry, their gymnasiums and athletics, and
the school diamond and amphitheater. Pause before you ostracize
me from my schools.</p>

<p>Would you be an essayist, sketching graphic stories or typical
characters; an historian, cataloging the treasures of archives,
and chronicling epochs of catastrophe and calm; or a philosopher,
systematizing theories of Stoics, Hedonists, Peripatetics
and Scholastics; or a poet, composing idylls and madrigals,
lyrics and odes with strophes and the epics with episodes, you
are mine. Without me you have not talents or ideas or paper
or ink. Mine are your grammar and syntax, your syllables,
your paragraphs with their commas and colons and parentheses,
your lexicons and encyclopedias and card-catalogs, your topics
and themes for ecstatic rhapsodies or for austere logic, your
fantastic paradoxes and your idiotic theories. ’Tis I who
phrase for you your axioms, caustic criticisms, laconic epigrams,
all your irony and sardonic sarcasm. If your technique is
idiomatic, your methods puzzling or crystal, your tropes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
metaphors graphic, your fancies hectic or anæmic, you are mine.
I am your enthusiastic stenographer, jotting down and synopsizing
your ideas and typing them to be stereotyped in your
authentic tomes, whether anonymous or under a pseudonym.</p>

<p>I apologize for my tautologies, for this monotonous labyrinth,
for the phalanx of technicalities and for the etymological mosaic
which strangles your larynx with “ics” and “isms.” Whether
it is all abysmal bathos, or the climax and acme of the practical,
I am to blame for it.</p>

<p>But pause before you ostracize me from my schools; pause ere
the nemesis of chaos and disaster is yours; but if you are to
be characterized as adamant and without sympathy, let the poets
echo a threnody about my coffin; let there be a chorus of pæans
under the cypress and cedar, the larch and osier, the myrtle and
amaranth, about my cenotaph; let there be in my cemetery a
mausoleum with a monolith, and on it my epitaph:</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="NOTE_THE_NATURE_OF_ESTHETIC_ENJOYMENT">NOTE: THE NATURE OF ESTHETIC ENJOYMENT</h3>

</div>

<p>Esthetic pleasure or the enjoyment of the beautiful is
generally admitted to be disinterested. Possession and
ownership do not enter into the esthetic act. The ownership of
Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” is not an object of indifference or of
disinterested attention. Thieves scheme for the ownership,
thousands covet it, guards protect it. But the enjoyment of
“Mona Lisa” is not selfish and exclusive in its nature. Esthetic
enjoyment makes abstraction of possession and of selfish good.
It follows therefore that esthetic enjoyment is a function of
man’s knowledge, not of man’s desires and appetites. The only
condition upon which the appetites, whether bodily or spiritual,
can operate is that they be energized by personal good. Volition
may be free, but it cannot be disinterested. You may enjoy
another’s picture; you cannot eat his dinner, nor can you be
indifferent to what you know to be for your good.</p>

<p>Some have asserted that esthetic enjoyment belongs to a
special power apart from both knowledge and appetite. There
is however no need of such power. Certainly beauty must be
known to be enjoyed, but is not the knowledge itself adequate to
produce the characteristic effect of beauty? Is not Aquinas
right in saying, “Pulchrum dicitur id cujus ipsa apprehensio
placet” (that is called beautiful which simply by its perception
pleases)? Good, being an end, cannot delight solely by being
perceived; good must be attained. But for beauty, is not its
very perception an enjoyment? The solution of this question
will be found in the nature of enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>Emotions and feelings, pleasure and pain are easy to understand
and for that reason difficult to express in satisfactory
formulas. By its very nature every faculty of man operating
normally has an accompanying pleasure, while if operating
abnormally it has pain. The faculty itself is therefore the
subject of the feeling just as life is inherent in the organism.
Indeed feeling is consciously localized life. The feeling of the
toe is felt by the toe; the joy of seeing is felt by the eye. No
distinct power is required to carry the feeling. So it is with
esthetic emotions. The mind itself feels the delight of beauty.
Esthetic enjoyment is a function of perception.</p>

<p>Does esthetic enjoyment belong to the senses and to the
imagination? Here again there is difference of opinion. It is
probable, however, that sensible perception has no accompanying
esthetic pleasure. St. Augustine appealed to experience and
declared that esthetic enjoyment of the beauty, say, of the sun,
was possible, even when the sight suffered pain. A better
reason may be found in the behavior of animals which, though
clothed in beauty, give us no certain evidence of esthetic
appreciation and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Esthetic enjoyment therefore belongs to intellectual cognition.
Now the intellect has many operations. Which one of these
carries the esthetic pleasure or esthetic pain, which one is
charged with the vital thrill that creates and appreciates the
world of art? The mind reasons, the mind judges, the mind
apprehends. Esthetic enjoyment belongs to the last. Judgments
and inferences may be objects of esthetic enjoyment; to reason,
to judge may precede or follow or may be even necessary conditions,
but the esthetic act is most probably one of simple
apprehension. There would seem to be general agreement that
contemplation is the characteristic attitude of the mind in the
presence of beauty. Aquinas excludes distinctly the idea of end
from beauty. Beauty is a form which we contemplate. Croce
calls the esthetic perception intuition. Theodore Watts-Dunton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
seems to be describing the same act when he calls poetry “the
renascence of wonder.” The efforts of reasoning and of judging
appear to be alien to the mental attitude in the presence of
beauty.</p>

<p>The simple apprehension is concerned with what is termed
ontological truth, whereas reasoning and judging result in
logical truth. Now, just as esthetic enjoyment abstracts from
possession or good, so does it abstract from the affirmations
belonging to the logical truth of judgment and of rational
inference. There is esthetic enjoyment of fiction as well as of
fact. Aristotle long ago saw that although the substance of art
must be the persons, actions and feelings of man, the pleasure
found in the work of art does not arise from its correspondence
with reality. The correspondence with reality gives the satisfaction
of logical truth, of scientific truth, of historical fact.
The truth which is the object of esthetic pleasure in art is the
truth of consistency, of realization of ideal, the truth of reasonable
congruity, of plot in a wide sense of the term. This vision,
this dream of the artist, scholastic philosophers call <i>causa
exemplaris</i> or ideal. If we are right in our understanding of
Croce, his intuition is nothing else but the simple apprehension
of the ideal. Esthetic enjoyment comes also, as is clear, from
the simple apprehension of beauty in natural realities where
there is no fiction of art.</p>

<p>To localize the esthetic enjoyment in this way does not determine
the constituent elements of beauty, but clear definitions
help to exclude many false notions of beauty. The ideal of the
artist is embodied in his imagination before it is expressed in its
proper medium. The art of man always must have a medium
which can be perceived by the senses. That is why a vigorous
imagination, which stores up and dispenses to its owner quickly
and abundantly of its riches, is so useful to the artist. Through
his imagination the artist is original and personal. The pure
thought of science is abstract and alike in all minds; the artistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
vision formed from individual experience will be different in
every one. Therefore no two artists expressing themselves in
the concrete can be alike as no two scenes of nature are alike
in beauty.</p>

<p>Aristotle put the pleasure of art in perception. Art for him is
a <i>mimesis</i>, which does not mean an imitation, in the sense of
mirroring or copying. That was Plato’s notion, which Aristotle
combated. Art is, in Aristotle, a power analogous to nature,
working like nature in another and limited world, of sound, of
color, of human thoughts. Art is fiction, a dramatizing, a
staging of life, to be judged, not by correspondence with fact,
but by its own plausible and convincing rationalization. No one
has done more for art than Aristotle in his insistence upon the
necessity of cause and effect, of a motivation, sufficient at least
for the artist’s public. Intrinsic unity, the fruit of perfect
motivation, was another necessary requisite in Aristotle’s analysis
of art. It is only when the varied elements of the artist’s
imaginative experience have fused themselves into a unity by
having a well-motivated beginning, middle and end that the mind
feels the beauty of its vision.</p>

<p>Universality in art is another fruitful idea of Aristotle.
While confined to his sensible medium, the artist must link up
the separate elements of his vision more closely than in the
realm of fact. He will by that very reason be general and
universal because his motivation must approve itself to all. A
moving picture of the death of Cæsar as it really occurred
would be valuable history. It would, however, be individual.
Shakespeare’s death of Cæsar has a beginning, middle and end,
and the spectators see in it the working out of a plot in which
every word and act has been carefully planned and fitted into
the design. The individuating notes are left out, and the death
of a Cæsar has universal appeal.</p>

<p>Artistic creation, motivation, unity, universality, these are
great principles of art formulated by Aristotle and not likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
ever to be superseded. The cognitive idea of beauty and those
principles of Aristotle have been followed in the chapters of
this book.</p>

<span class="smaller">(<i>To exemplify <a href="#IX">Chapter IX</a></i>)</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>THE METHOD</h4>

<p>THE dry bones in the cold print of this lesson are to be
galvanized into life by a teacher in constant touch with
the class and enlisting the coöperation by questions, by having
the passage read aloud, by writing on the board, by interchanges
of ideas, by lively disputes between individuals. No mere
lecture with passive listeners, no mere study period with a
passive overseer, but real teaching, which is a fine conversation,
directed upon select subjects and carried to a destined end under
expert guidance.</p>

<p>All of the technical terms, apprehension, judgment, inference
and the rest are to be omitted. The intelligent use of such
terms belongs to college, although the operations and objects
which the terms designate belong to all grades. Through
simple, untechnical questions the whole truth may be understood
by each, and every student may be made to go through operations
which are of daily occurrence and which the student must
make habitual by repeated exercise to insure a mastery of the
art of expression. The teacher is an expert mental director, and,
setting before the class a good passage of literature, he will
make them think again and put in order again and express again
what the author has done; he will make them conceive, arrange
and express thoughts of their own with the excellence which
teacher and class have noted and appreciated in the passage.
The teacher of literature will be no lecturer in history or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
philosophy or in mathematics, but will be like the teacher of
music or like the physical trainer, who makes his class go
through exercises which he himself has exemplified and which
the class immediately practice to acquire bodily skill then and
for the future.</p>

<p>A passage of poetry is designedly taken in this lesson to show
how poetry can be made to contribute to the art of expression.
Literature for some is history, for others philosophy. These
center attention on the facts or ideas. Literature for others is
a dreamy, mysterious thing, which you must look at with awe,
speak about with esoteric rhapsody and carefully lock up again
in a glass case. A forward looking lesson in literature must
know what the passage means, but is usually not concerned with
the origin and past history of the author’s meaning. The
forward-looking lesson will not pretend to solve all the mysteries
of art and beauty but will take out of the clouds and put
clearly before the class some point in the art of expression, a
point which will be practical and of everyday use. Such a lesson
will be as decidedly vocational as hammering a nail or rigging
up a radio set or rushing around a gymnasium.</p>

<p>The purpose ever before the literature teacher’s mind is
appreciation, leading to mental action and through repeated
action to the art of expression.</p>

</div>

<h4>I. ANALYSIS OF THOUGHT</h4>

<p>1. <i>Understanding.</i>—The meaning of each word, the meaning
of each line, the meaning of the whole stanza. This should not
be a mere passive understanding. Students should be made to
reëxpress the ideas, not only by paraphrase in other words but
especially by <i>imaginative realization</i>. “For instance,” “Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
like what?” are two phrases to be often on the teacher’s lips.
“Have you a heard a curfew?” “Have you heard a knell tolling?”
“Did you ever see in picture or in reality a lowing herd winding
o’er the lea?” A thought illustrated by the thinker’s imagination
is realized fully, is felt as well as grasped, and will persist.</p>

<p>2. <i>Judgment.</i>—What is the logical subject and logical predicate
of each line and of the whole stanza? That is, what is the
author’s chief topic and what does he say about it? This need
not always be the grammatical subject of the passage. The art
of expression is not only apprehending by vivid understanding,
but it is also judging by predication, by affirming or denying
something of the subject. There is not a class of any grade
which cannot profitably exercise itself in clear and concise
judgements. The successive judgements briefly put are: The bell
tells the end of day: the cows return to the barn: the ploughman
comes home: I am left alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>3. <i>Reasoning.</i>—As as single sentence may be analyzed into a
definite subject and a definite predicate for a judgment, so two
or more sentences may be compared to grasp the relation between
them. Poetry does not go through a process of reasoning.
It states thoughts and presents pictures, permitting the mind to
infer. The three pictures in the opening lines have a common
trait which the mind detects: all three pictures are signs of
nightfall. The mind draws an inference which is inductive in
nature, and the whole stanza may be briefly stated: The coming
of night leaves me alone in darkness.</p>

<p>These stages in analyzing the thought are elaborated here.
In practice they may be expedited. Before being read, the judgment
and inference may be presented as problems for solution:
What does the writer say in each line? What one idea is found
in the first three lines? What will be the title, the head-line,
the summary of each line and of the whole stanza?<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<h4>II. ANALYSIS OF FORM</h4>

<p>Form includes not only the words and sentences, their choice
and their arrangement, but also the texture and color of the
thoughts and their modification ending in their perfect expression,
as contrasted with the bare and limited statements already
determined. In the study of literature, words are not merely
materials for philologizing, or merely sentences, free opportunities
for grammatical anatomizing with all the bones properly
numbered and labeled. Such analyses look chiefly backward and
are not productive of writers. Language anatomy has its great
utility, but literature, or the art of expression, must look to the
flesh and blood of the thoughts, to the personality, to the
imagination, to the concrete embodiment of the writer’s art.
The student will take up, therefore, the thought already
analyzed and note and appreciate how his author has clothed
the ideas, the judgments, the reasoning. He will reënact the
creative process the author went through, and so here, with a
view to expression, he will strive to rival the excellence of Gray,
but will do so with his own thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Grading.</i>—At this stage the teacher may point out incidentally
many excellences in the art of expression, but will drill and have
practice on the particular excellence in expression, proper to his
class. The textbook ordinarily determines the grade, but if
there is no textbook or prescribed program, the teacher will
determine his own order of matter.</p>

<p><i>Right Word.</i>—Let us suppose the teacher is teaching the art
of using the right word (<i>Model English</i>, 3), the word which
states the thing exactly in kind. He may center attention on the
line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The class will be drilled in the author’s choice of the right
word by considering other possible but less exact combinations,
e.g.: A number of noisy cows went reluctantly along. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
this drill, the class will appreciate what the right word is and be
ready for the expression of their own ideas in right words.
They are not to paraphrase Gray’s meaning. That has already
been done, but they are to provide subject-matter of their own
and express it with a like excellence. Did they continue to
speak of cows, they could not better Gray, but if they speak of
bees or bloodhounds or cavalry or autumn leaves or rioters or
anything else that has come under their experience in life or in
reading, they might approach the exactness of Gray in giving the
right word for the sound, for the collection, for the action, for
the manner and for the place.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Bees</i>: the buzzing swarm of bees circled thickly about the
hive.</p>

<p><i>Bloodhounds</i>: the baying pack of hounds followed the trail
eagerly.</p>

<p><i>Cavalry</i>: the clattering squadron of cavalry galloped swiftly
along the road.</p>

<p><i>Autumn</i>: the heaps of rustling leaves were swept into every
corner by autumn winds.</p>

<p><i>Rioters</i>: the yelling mob of rioters rushed wildly towards the
jail.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Imagination.</i>—Suppose the teacher is giving a lesson in
imagination (“Model English,” Chap. X). If one of the
<i>General Methods</i>, say <i>Reflecting</i> (No. 69), is to be taught, then
the class must vividly picture in their imaginations Gray’s
stanza. With the help of books on the desk and with a gesture
or two the scene and all its characters may be <i>dramatized</i>. All
this suggestively rather than with exact mimicry, unless there is
in question a passage that may be reproduced by the class in a
miniature pageant or play. To test whether the class is actually
imagining, have them quickly number, one after another, the
things they see and hear directly by the words and indirectly
suggested by the words. Or test in another way. Let each
draw an outline of the frame of a picture and show how they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
would illustrate any line or the whole stanza, putting numbers
on the blank space to locate the details and explaining to the side
what the numbers stand for.</p>

<p>Suppose a <i>particular method, significant part for the whole</i>
(No. 73) be the matter of the lesson, then the whole which is
expressed by Gray is “evening,” or “parting day,” pictured by
three significant details—curfew, cows and ploughman. Have
the class take an opposite situation—not evening in a graveyard
in preparation for gloomy thoughts, but morning on the farm
looking to a busy, joyous day. Or again, what significant details
will suggest the hush of evening in a city or on the sea; noon in a
factory, closing of school in the afternoon, coming of winter in
December, dawning of spring in April, etc. Interest may be
accentuated if one student gives the details and others imagine
what is the whole suggested. For example: The cock crows a
greeting to the rising sun; the team of horses is hitched to the
mowing machine, and soon the clicking knives lay low the
waving grass (farm); the crank is whirled about with a swift
revolution and jerking stop; the low purr of a hidden engine
steals upon the ear and a cloud of dust swallows up the rattling
car (a Ford); a sprig of shamrock graces the lapel of the coat;
green ribbons flaunt gayly above ruddy cheeks, and down the
street steps a band jigging Garryowen (St. Patrick’s Day). In
the same way elements of force or interest, metrical charm or
poetic thought and many other points could be taught from this
stanza, according to the grade of the class before the teacher.
Whatever the passage taken, once the grade has been settled, the
artistic drill should be carried through the stages of grasping
the thought definitely, of appreciating it with discrimination, of
repeating the process of creation, of dramatizing the complete
product, and finally of self-expression on the part of the student,
striving to rival the author in the excellence he has studied.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> This “mosaic of etymology” which I offer is not, I think, simply
an ingenious <i>tour de force</i>. It has a significance and a practical
value. It may illustrate the composite nature of the English
language; it may amuse a curious reader; it may enliven a Greek
class with the touch of actuality; it may disclose dim vistas into
the distant past through the medium of everyday language, exemplifying
history through common things. All the words of this
phantasy are of Greek origin, except the article, the pronouns,
the prepositions and conjunctions, and a few other small words:
“so, as, then, home, let, go, do, all” and parts of the verb “to be.”
Skeat’s <i>Etymological Dictionary</i> (Student’s edition) is the authority.
The exclusively technical words of modern sciences which
are almost wholly Greek have not, for the most part, been mentioned.
It is needless to remark that the prescriptions of the
phantom’s pharmacy are not authoritative.</p>

<p>This <i>jeu d’esprit</i> has attracted so much attention as to be reprinted
by the American Classical Association and to be noticed
by several metropolitan editors. That attention is the motive for
giving the article permanent position in a book with which a novel
plea for Greek has a certain, though remote, connection.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
